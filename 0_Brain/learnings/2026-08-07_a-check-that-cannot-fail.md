# A check that cannot fail is not a check

**The shape.** A verification runs, reports success, and could never have
reported anything else — because it measured the wrong thing, errored and
swallowed it, or asked a question whose answer was fixed in advance. It is worse
than no check, because it converts an open question into a settled one.

**Four occurrences on 2026-08-07 alone, across three agents and me:**

1. **Mine — the close-bell 403.** I verified the API key's value, length and
   byte-equality with a working one, and concluded it was valid. It was. The key
   was never reaching the process that used it (`source` without `set -a`).
   **Every check I ran was on the key at rest, and non-delivery is invisible to
   all of them.** Two nights of failure, and a wrong root cause reported to Kam.
2. **Vision — a private-key scan that errored and still printed "clean".** The
   shell scan of a mail for key material hit the `-----BEGIN` lines, read the
   leading dash as a flag, errored on exactly the two lines that mattered, and
   reported clean anyway.
3. **Vision — a print-layout check measuring a hidden element.** It measured
   `#quoteDoc` heights and got `0`, because the element is `display:none` on
   screen. Zero looked like a pass. Replaced with a real PDF render — which then
   found a customer-facing defect on page 2 that reading the source had missed.
4. **NexusAI — a `find` that timed out and read as a negative result.** A search
   for `pane_prompt_check.sh` silently timed out traversing an external drive and
   returned nothing; the agent came one step from reporting my evidence as
   fabricated on the strength of it. Their phrase: *"checking a premise badly is
   not checking it, and it fails in the direction that feels like diligence."*

**Why this is a distinct lesson and not just "verify properly".** All four
verifications were *performed*. The people running them were being careful —
that is the trap. `always-verify-and-check` fires on "did I check?", and every
one of these answers yes. The question it does not ask is **"could this check
have come out differently?"**

**How to apply — one question, asked of the check rather than the result:**

1. **"What would make this check fail?"** If there is no concrete answer, the
   check is decorative. For a credential: *what would show a valid key that
   never arrived?* — printing `len(key)` inside the failing process. For a
   layout: *what would show a broken page?* — the rendered artefact, not a
   hidden element's geometry.
2. **A zero, an empty result and a silent success are suspects, not evidence.**
   Zero rows, zero height, no matches, "clean" — each is equally consistent with
   "nothing is wrong" and "the check never ran". Distinguish them before
   reporting.
3. **Never let a non-zero exit be swallowed.** Occurrence 2 is
   [[2026-08-06_never-discard-stderr]] wearing a different hat: the error was
   printed *and ignored*, which is the same as discarding it.
4. **Prefer checking the artefact over checking the intent** — the rendered PDF,
   the served page, the value inside the failing process. Generating the real
   output beat reading the source twice in one day on the same project.
5. **When a check surprises you by passing, be as suspicious as when it fails.**
   Three of these four looked like good news.

**Meta-note:** the formulation is the Vision agent's, arrived at independently
while I was diagnosing my own instance of it. That is the second protocol
improvement the fleet handed me today. My job is to notice and propagate them.
