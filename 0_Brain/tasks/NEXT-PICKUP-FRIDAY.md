# NEXT PICKUP — FRIDAY

**The tree is at `/Users/kamilkreiser/1FILES TO SYNC/FRIDAY`.** Quote every path (spaces).

## 🔴 FIRST, EVERY BOOT AND EVERY CHECKPOINT
- `kam_rulings_today.sh`, then `python3 2_Project_Files/tools/reconcile_rulings.py` (then `--apply`).
- The live-board wake is `fleet/cockpit/live_chat_poll.sh --seat friday`; the SHARED launcher arms it (09b28c3b6). Kam's posts arrive as "[Wednesday tap] [live-board] …" within ~30 s.
- **Before ANY `git pull` of this tree: commit Friday's own data files first** (`0_Brain/dashboard/data/decisions.json`, `chat_friday.json`, `0_Brain/daily_friday/.spoken.log`, the note). Today an autostash stranded a card + 15 messages (ledger w=1).
- STATUS wake: `2_Project_Files/friday/watch_status.sh <seen-file> "<glob>"` (fixed today: paths with spaces; `<…>` and ALL_CAPS placeholder READY lines ignored). Re-arm it for anything live.

## 🔴 LIVE AT THE ROTATION
1. **Composer B07 SEAT-B — the HISTORY REWRITE** (pane `Datasec/Security-Composer-B`).
   - Kam 14:26:04, card `composer-sow-history-rewrite`: **c — Rewrite history now.** Brief: `Datasec Security Composer/1_Project_Definition/Briefs/2026-09-25_B07_SEAT-B_rewrite-history-remove-sow-sentences.md`.
   - The seat has made the backup mirror `Datasec Security Composer/_quarantine_2026-09-25_HPSM-light-mirror-before-rewrite/` (rung 6).
   - **Re-arm the STATUS watcher on `…/Briefs/2026-09-25_B07*STATUS*.md`.**
   - On READY:
     - check the new main tree = `ba67540`'s tree (`bc916715…`);
     - check all branches with `ls-remote`;
     - read the residuals (GitHub `refs/pull/*`: only GitHub Support can purge; the other clones incl. `HPSM/6_Policy_Composer` and the T9/Studio copies; the VM archives) and tell Kam plainly.
2. **Composer: OWED — ONE NEW finished example engagement on the new content release** (Kam 14:26:21 card a, the 3rd clause).
   - The demo now runs release `bfecdc77…` (deployed 14:3x). The 8 kept examples are pinned to `2971ffc4`: read-only, no exports.
   - Brief a Composer seat to walk one engagement to RELEASED on the LIVE demo through the UI (clearly labelled as an example; creating labelled test data on the demo is allowed per its launcher). Do it AFTER B07 finishes (one seat at a time on that folder).
   - Tell Kam when it's there.
3. **Nothing else is running.** HPSM-POC showcase: all merged (main 3029930, CI green); the showcase pack is in Kam's file drawer. HPSM analysis repo: pushed (private `datasecau/HPSM-analysis`).

## Small, queued (not started)
- HPSM-POC: swap the action-plan screen from the browser store to A's API (0.4.0 on main); the dashboard phase chart → getShowcaseSummary. One web seat.
- HPSM-POC: commit the `1_Project_Definition/Showcase/` folder (the pack + build script + INDEX) to the analysis repo with the next records pass.

## Kam's hands (asked; defaults stated)
- 9 Azure providers (a hosted HPSM-POC link; default: the laptop showcase via `scripts/showcase.sh`).
- The HP E8 SOW extract file into Composer `1_Project_Definition/Source_Documents/` (CI's one red step).

## Today's decisions (all recorded + delivered)
- HPSM-POC C-17 (keep the draft findings).
- Composer C-05 (fold deploy; content fix; clause ids; 360 accept) and C-06 (keep phrases; rewrite history now; deploy + badge + a new example).
- The Spark is Wednesday's: Kam ruled Secuura may use it, and the container was recreated. It still fails on tilelang; Wednesday is on it.

## Left in place (never delete)
- `git stash list` autostash entries in this tree.
- HPSM-POC worktrees `.tools/wt-B0*`, `wt-B10-C`; container `b07c-mssql` (stopped).
- Composer compose project `pc-b03` (up); the demo VM's `.pre-friday-*` backups and `composer.prev`; `/opt/hpsm/composer-*.tar.gz` archives (old content, a residual for the rewrite report).
