# NEXT PICKUP — FRIDAY

**The tree is at `/Users/kamilkreiser/1FILES TO SYNC/FRIDAY`.** Quote every path (spaces).

## 🔴 FIRST, EVERY BOOT AND EVERY CHECKPOINT
- `kam_rulings_today.sh`, then `python3 2_Project_Files/tools/reconcile_rulings.py` (then `--apply`).
- The live-board wake is `fleet/cockpit/live_chat_poll.sh --seat friday` (armed by the shared launcher). Kam's posts arrive as "[Wednesday tap] [live-board] …".
- **Before ANY `git pull` of this tree: commit Friday's own data files first** (decisions.json, chat_friday.json, usage_friday.json, .spoken.log, the note). When committing, use `git commit -- <paths>`: other tools stage chat_tuesday/chat_wednesday.json, and those are not Friday's.
- STATUS wake: `2_Project_Files/friday/watch_status.sh <seen-file> "<glob>"`. It keys on the COUNT of READY lines, so a seat that re-saves a finished STATUS will NOT re-fire it; check idle panes.
- Unregistered project folder (HPSM: its launcher needs DevMASTER) → `cockpit.sh add <Name> "bash '…/2_Project_Files/friday/brief_seat.sh' <client> '<dir>' '<brief>'"`. Register the pane name in `fleet/inbox_routing.conf` BEFORE a `say --mail` tap: without a line, say --mail exits 1 SILENTLY (the fix is owed).

- **The LAPTOP SLEEPS.** Arm `caffeinate -dims -t 21600` (background) in the same action as launching any seat, and check `pgrep -fl caffeinate` at boot. On 09-25 it slept at ~17:0x and cut two seats' turns. One was armed at 17:4x until ~23:4x.

## 🔴 LIVE (refreshed 19:48 by the 19:37 successor seat)
1. **HPSM-POC B16 cold-user RE-RUN: LIVE** (pane `Datasec/HPSM-POC-C` %19). Brief `HPSM-POC/1_Project_Definition/Briefs/2026-09-25_B16_SEAT-C_cold-user-rerun-after-fixes.md`. Watcher glob `…/HPSM-POC/1_Project_Definition/Briefs/2026-09-25_B16*STATUS*.md`. On READY:
   - verify one GONE claim at source (a screenshot);
   - send Kam the top 5 + the file;
   - then brief a fix round for anything STILL THERE / NEW (not Kam's or the SME's).
2. **Composer B10 two examples: LIVE** (pane `Datasec/Security-Composer-B` %20). Brief `Datasec Security Composer/1_Project_Definition/Briefs/2026-09-25_B10_SEAT-B_two-example-engagements-d023-on-and-manual.md` (Kam C-08: A = D-023 On, B = Manual approval). Watcher glob `…/Datasec Security Composer/1_Project_Definition/Briefs/2026-09-25_B10*STATUS*.md`. On READY: view one released screenshot per example, grep exports for the password (control), tell Kam with both names.
3. DONE this seat: B14 merged + main CI green (ca554a6); Composer typed-answers release DEPLOYED to the demo (b0b512c, content efad540b, 0018 applied; temp key removed and proven; C-08); SOW AI-clause wording delivered (HPSM-POC C-20, drawer f-4ca8dff847).
4. **Open Friday cards: 0.** New account: usage 26% at 19:4x.
5. caffeinate `-dims -t 21600` armed DETACHED at 19:37 (pid 22618, sess 0 / tty ??), until ~01:3x. It survives a rotation; check `pgrep -fl "caffeinate -dims"` anyway.

## NEXT (owed, in order)
1. ~~HPSM-POC B14 fix round~~ DONE and merged; the re-run is LIVE 1. Source: the B12 user test STATUS `HPSM-POC/1_Project_Definition/Briefs/2026-09-25_B12_SEAT-C_end-to-end-user-test-as-a-salesperson.STATUS.md` (46 findings).
   - Fix every finding that is not Kam's or the SME's. FIRST: internal notes on screen, incl. the named person ("Kam/Paul Waite meeting" footer).
   - Then: the contradictions (sample customers' narrative/report pages say "No assessment yet"; question totals 16/15/14; identical 54.2); Reset demo not resetting live data; the calculator overwriting the dashboard ARR; the "Demo Consultant" header; readiness Download greyed out.
   - **Plus C-19:** showcase mode scores NEW customers with the draft rules, labelled DRAFT (outside showcase mode C-15 still refuses).
   - Then RE-RUN the cold-user test (driver `B12-C_evidence/seat-notes/userdriver.js`).
2. **Customer maturity-assessment questions:** Kam requested them from HP (16:03). They are in NO file we hold (measured across HPSM-POC Source_Documents + the whole "HP Playbook Project" folder; Tuesday measured the T9). When they arrive → load as content; the ruleset stays DRAFT (C-15/C-19). Optional frame offered to Kam: the PRD's TRUST/KNOW/PROTECT/MANAGE/GOVERN model (no change unless he says).

## Kam's hands (asked; defaults stated)
- **GitHub Support request** (in his drawer, `0_Brain/reference/2026-09-25_sow-sentence-rewrite/github-support-request.md`): purge HPSM-light's 4 PR refs + cached objects in both repos. Kam sends.
- 9 Azure providers (a hosted HPSM-POC link; default: the laptop showcase via `scripts/showcase.sh`).
- Residuals of the SOW rewrite, his to decide: the T9 + NAS copies of the old clone; Tuesday's HPSM zips in his drawer. Reflogs + bundles + mirrors are kept on purpose (the undo).

## Today (all recorded + delivered)
- Composer: B07 history rewrite (HPSM-light main `7855f10`); B08 example engagement released (EXAMPLE — Quollbrook Freight Co, `60503ab0-…`); C-07 (answers flow, Support request, copies).
- HPSM: B02 rewrite of datasecau/HPSM-analysis (main now `03afbf8`); `6_Policy_Composer` re-cloned; old clone + `added/` copies quarantined with push URLs DISABLED; C-75, C-76.
- HPSM-POC: B11 merged (#20, main `149d15f`); B12 user test; C-18, C-19.
- Files Kam shared today, filed (git-ignored, hash-verified): `HPSM/1_Project_Definition/Source_Documents/HP Playbook Project/` + 5 loose items + `HPSM_Policy_Composer_2026-09-10/` (also copied to Composer's Source_Documents for ci.sh).
- The Spark: UP (Wednesday fixed the tilelang boot-hook pin, 05:05Z). It is Wednesday's box today; claim it before any long run.

## Left in place (never delete)
- `git stash list` autostash entries in this tree.
- HPSM-POC worktrees `.tools/wt-B0*`, `wt-B1*`; container `b07c-mssql` (stopped).
- Composer compose `pc-b03`; the demo VM's `.pre-friday-*` backups, `composer.prev`, `/opt/hpsm/composer-*.tar.gz`.
- All `_quarantine_2026-09-25_*` folders in Composer and HPSM (the undo for both rewrites).
