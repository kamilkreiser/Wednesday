# NEXT PICKUP — FRIDAY

**The tree is at `/Users/kamilkreiser/1FILES TO SYNC/FRIDAY`.** Quote every path (spaces).

## 🔴 FIRST, EVERY BOOT AND EVERY CHECKPOINT
- `kam_rulings_today.sh`, then `python3 2_Project_Files/tools/reconcile_rulings.py` (then `--apply`).
- The live-board wake is `fleet/cockpit/live_chat_poll.sh --seat friday` (armed by the shared launcher). Kam's posts arrive as "[Wednesday tap] [live-board] …".
- **Before ANY `git pull` of this tree: commit Friday's own data files first** (decisions.json, chat_friday.json, usage_friday.json, .spoken.log, the note). When committing, use `git commit -- <paths>`: other tools stage chat_tuesday/chat_wednesday.json, and those are not Friday's.
- STATUS wake: `2_Project_Files/friday/watch_status.sh <seen-file> "<glob>"`. It keys on the COUNT of READY lines, so a seat that re-saves a finished STATUS will NOT re-fire it; check idle panes.
- Unregistered project folder (HPSM: its launcher needs DevMASTER) → `cockpit.sh add <Name> "bash '…/2_Project_Files/friday/brief_seat.sh' <client> '<dir>' '<brief>'"`. Register the pane name in `fleet/inbox_routing.conf` BEFORE a `say --mail` tap: without a line, say --mail exits 1 SILENTLY (the fix is owed).

- **The LAPTOP SLEEPS.** Arm `caffeinate -dims -t 21600` (background) in the same action as launching any seat, and check `pgrep -fl caffeinate` at boot. On 09-25 it slept at ~17:0x and cut two seats' turns. One was armed at 17:4x until ~23:4x.

## 🔴 LIVE (refreshed 21:3x by the 19:37 successor seat, ctx 59%)
1. **PR #23 (B18 Azure OpenAI + Kam's template approval, head e943e0b)** and **PR #24 (B17 fixes + C-21 features, head 6d27983)**: both reviewed + ACCEPTED; CI polls were running at 21:35. **0 shared files** (compare API), so order is free. Merge each head-pinned (`gh pr merge N --squash --match-head-commit <full sha>`), read main back, then the main push-CI. After BOTH: `pdftotext` a fresh executive PDF shows no "AI-assisted" (B17's provenance label must win on the combined main).
2. B18 records pushed (analysis repo tip 1c8b6f4); seat C closed. **B17's records are still UNCOMMITTED in the analysis repo** (its STATUS, B17-B_evidence, history entry): item 0 of the next HPSM-POC seat, by explicit path.
3. **NEXT seat after both merges (Friday's decision, v1.3):** one automatic retry on a narrative validator refusal (severity-mismatch), a UI "Try again" that states the reason, and a stricter check that catches "critical" for a non-critical finding and any "compliance" claim. No template text change (that is card `hpsmpoc-templates-v101`). Then a fresh cold-user re-run in AI mode (`scripts/showcase-ai.sh`).
4. **Open Friday cards:** `hpsmpoc-pdf-approver-name` (default: date only), `hpsmpoc-templates-v101` (default: 1.0.0 stays).
5. caffeinate `-dims -t 21600` DETACHED 19:37 (pid 22618) until ~01:3x. Seats run on the default ~/.claude = the new account since Kam's 20:12 login (seat C statusline 7d:30%).

## NEXT (owed, in order)
1. ~~HPSM-POC B14 fix round~~ DONE and merged; the re-run is LIVE 1. Source: the B12 user test STATUS `HPSM-POC/1_Project_Definition/Briefs/2026-09-25_B12_SEAT-C_end-to-end-user-test-as-a-salesperson.STATUS.md` (46 findings).
   - Fix every finding that is not Kam's or the SME's. FIRST: internal notes on screen, incl. the named person ("Kam/Paul Waite meeting" footer).
   - Then: the contradictions (sample customers' narrative/report pages say "No assessment yet"; question totals 16/15/14; identical 54.2); Reset demo not resetting live data; the calculator overwriting the dashboard ARR; the "Demo Consultant" header; readiness Download greyed out.
   - **Plus C-19:** showcase mode scores NEW customers with the draft rules, labelled DRAFT (outside showcase mode C-15 still refuses).
   - Then RE-RUN the cold-user test (driver `B12-C_evidence/seat-notes/userdriver.js`).
2. **Customer maturity-assessment questions:** Kam requested them from HP (16:03). They are in NO file we hold (measured across HPSM-POC Source_Documents + the whole "HP Playbook Project" folder; Tuesday measured the T9). When they arrive → load as content; the ruleset stays DRAFT (C-15/C-19). Optional frame offered to Kam: the PRD's TRUST/KNOW/PROTECT/MANAGE/GOVERN model (no change unless he says).

## Kam's hands (asked; defaults stated)
- **GitHub Support request** (in his drawer, `0_Brain/reference/2026-09-25_sow-sentence-rewrite/github-support-request.md`): purge HPSM-light's 4 PR refs + cached objects in both repos. Kam sends.
- 9 Azure providers (a hosted HPSM-POC link; default: the laptop showcase via `scripts/showcase.sh`).
- Residuals of the SOW rewrite, his to decide: the T9 + NAS copies of the old clone; Tuesday's HPSM zips in his drawer. Reflogs + bundles + mirrors are kept on purpose (the undo).

## Today (all recorded + delivered)
- Composer: B07 history rewrite (HPSM-light main `7855f10`); B08 example engagement released (EXAMPLE — Quollbrook Freight Co, `60503ab0-…`); C-07 (answers flow, Support request, copies).
- HPSM: B02 rewrite of datasecau/HPSM-analysis (main now `03afbf8`); `6_Policy_Composer` re-cloned; old clone + `added/` copies quarantined with push URLs DISABLED; C-75, C-76.
- HPSM-POC: B11 merged (#20, main `149d15f`); B12 user test; C-18, C-19.
- Files Kam shared today, filed (git-ignored, hash-verified): `HPSM/1_Project_Definition/Source_Documents/HP Playbook Project/` + 5 loose items + `HPSM_Policy_Composer_2026-09-10/` (also copied to Composer's Source_Documents for ci.sh).
- The Spark: UP (Wednesday fixed the tilelang boot-hook pin, 05:05Z). It is Wednesday's box today; claim it before any long run.

## Left in place (never delete)
- `git stash list` autostash entries in this tree.
- HPSM-POC worktrees `.tools/wt-B0*`, `wt-B1*`; container `b07c-mssql` (stopped).
- Composer compose `pc-b03`; the demo VM's `.pre-friday-*` backups, `composer.prev`, `/opt/hpsm/composer-*.tar.gz`.
- All `_quarantine_2026-09-25_*` folders in Composer and HPSM (the undo for both rewrites).
