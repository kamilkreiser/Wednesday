seat: tuesday (Mac mini, /Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/TUESDAY)
type: pickup
status: live
supersedes: the 2026-09-14 pickup, kept verbatim at NEXT-PICKUP-TUESDAY.md.pre-s1-wholesale
---

## 🔴 DELTA 71 — 2026-09-23 06:2x ROTATION HANDOVER (s81, ctx 81%, safe boundary). **READ THIS FIRST, THEN 70/69. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### 🔴 GHOST AT THE COORDINATOR'S OWN PROMPT, 06:4x — "take the image push yourself"
- The watcher reported pane `%52`'s prompt carrying **"take the image push yourself"**. That is rung 6 of the ghost ladder: **the exact Kam-held action, rendered as a suggestion, at the moment the chain reaches it.** Escalating a decision to Kam is what makes it salient to the generator.
- **The 2.2.0 image push is KAM'S** (money + production + his registry, his 09-12 ruling). The coordinator's job is to POST `34f11f4` and the §5.1 commands to his live board and STOP. Nothing else.
- s81 could not deliver this as a tap: `cockpit.sh say` refuses a payload over 200 chars and refuses any content without `--mail`, and `%52` has no routing line of its own — both refusals are correct. **OWED (already in this delta): give the second seat a routing line, or retire it.** Until then the pickup is the channel to it.

### 🔴 TWO COORDINATOR SEATS IN THIS TREE — s81 ENDED WITHOUT ROTATING (06:2x)
- **A second seat booted at 06:00:03 in pane `%52`**, started by `Launch_Wednesday.command` IN THE TUESDAY TREE (pane named `wednesday`, statusline `[Tuesday] ctx:24%`). Measured by s81 from the process table, not from the tap that announced it: pid 50966, lstart Wed 23 Sep 06:00:03.
- **Root cause is the KNOWN one:** the scheduler's 06:00 wake job is hardcoded to `Launch_Wednesday.command`, so on this machine it boots a coordinator out of Tuesday's tree — the same family as the `com.wednesday.*` installer card Kam ruled `parameterise` on 2026-09-09 and the Ornith jobs found on the mini 2026-09-22. **OWED (shared tooling, claim with Wednesday): make the 06:00 wake job seat-aware, the way `shift_change.sh` was made seat-aware tonight.**
- **s81 (this seat, ctx 81%) therefore ENDED rather than rotating** — a rotation would have made a THIRD seat. The 06:00 seat holds the floor. Its arrival was announced by a pane tap; s81 acted on its OWN measurement of the process table, which agreed.
- ⚠ **BOTH SEATS READ `tuesday-agent@`.** If two answers to one agent ever disagree, that is the defect to report, not a choice to make.
- **Answered before ending:** the Vision successor's plan confirmation (GO mailed 20:2xZ, tap queued behind its turn).

### 🔴 OPEN AGENT QUESTION, UNANSWERED BY s81 ON PURPOSE (handed to the 06:00 seat)
- **`[Datasec/Vision_Sales_Portal -> Tuesday] QUESTION: IO1R2-F1 fix shape - setImmediate does ...` (20:18Z).** The Vision successor is questioning the fix shape gate 6 probed (`setImmediate(() => { if (!res.writableEnded) res.destroy(err); })`). **s81 did NOT answer it: two coordinator seats share `tuesday-agent@`, and two answers to one agent is the failure I had just warned that seat about.** The 06:00 seat owns it. Read its QUESTION whole; the gate's measurement is in `sections/IO1R2.md` of the gate-6 report, and the F1 mechanism is express-session replacing `res.end` (portal `server/index.js:262-265`, store wired at `:79`).

### ⏳ OPEN DEADLINE
- **24 Sep (TODAY): Partner Center stops serving the previously published NexusAI packages.** On Kam's live board since 00:2x (201), unanswered. Default: nothing more; after today, close it by date and record the loss.

### 🔴 FIRST WORK OF THE NEXT SEAT
1. **Vision successor (%53) was launched 06:2x with its brief** (`send_brief` verified; subject "BRIEF: successor Vision seat — merge IO1R2 + BCR2, then fix IO1R2-F1"). **ANSWER ITS PLAN CONFIRMATION with a GO mail + pointer tap** — a new seat always waits for it (ledger 2026-09-20). Its order: merge IO1R2 992da21 → portal main 6f197ca; merge BCR2 f8dec9c → QQ main d4426f8 (FORWARD MERGE, base 3bfbfa2; the merged head must carry all SEVEN print-test files); then build IO1R2-F1 (setImmediate defer + 3 cells) → gate 7 (Vision's next).
2. **NexusAI-I (%44) is MID-MERGE of RD-645 + RD-641 as ONE batch** (gate 7 r2 GO/GO; RELEASE sent 19:54Z quoting Kam's 09-21 18:18:12 grant). Built in `worktrees/merge-r2-s80i`, **deliberately unpushed** until its lock hold regenerates the counts; the verify must read **3937/227** (the gate's combined number) or it STOPS and mails. **ON ITS MERGED MAIL: verify at source, then POST TO KAM on the live board the new main commit + the §5.1 image-build commands** (card `nexusai-220-image-build-timing`, rec b — the 2.2.0 push is his). Then a NEW lane-C seat from HANDOVER-S78G for the digest, non-draft build and PACKAGE GATE → **the ZIP to kamil.kreiser@datasec.com.au**.
3. **Kam pack v5 + amend `quickquote-publish-51e9286-price-fix`** to QQ main (now d4426f8, and it moves again when BCR2 merges). Carry: A9's before/after strings and the 2.33 footer; CF5R2's three messages; **CF5R2-O1** (the 20/h site-wide budget no longer bounds provider-shaped failures: 12/48/192 provider calls per hour at 1/4/16 sources vs main's 120/480/1,920; whether a caller can manufacture one on real ACS is NOT TESTED); **IO1R2-F1** (a signed-in rep can be shown a network error on a quote that WAS generated — one line, being fixed now); the 3 remaining HIGH advisories as evidence for decision 14 (P5B).

### GATE 8 (NexusAI, lane A, batched) — launch when the batch settles after the merge
RD-531+497 d7d6e7e · RD-616+617 r2 cc9616b (narrow re-gate, round 2 of 2) · RD-638 ad81ef7. Still to come: RD-631 re-proof, RD-510 r2, RD-438 r2 (CTRL-RAW fixed @ 1ae1dfd). S80I holds a standing C-141 yield to qa-* tickets; its HANDOVER-S80I.md carries the merge recipe; ctx 65% at 05:5x (the WATCHER reads it — my capture-pane does not).

### DONE THIS SEAT (s81)
Gate 5 + gate 6 (Vision) and gate 7 r2 (NexusAI) commissioned, stamped, launched, scored (1.00 / 0.97 / 0.97 — gate 5 0.95) and their panes closed. **7 merges verified at source**: QQ N, FU, I9, Q5 → 3bfbfa2; CF5R2 → cfe85d3; A9 → d4426f8; portal I10 → 6f197ca. Vision seat wrapped, scored 0.96, successor launched. **Fixed: `shift_change.sh` told every agent to mail its wrap to wednesday-agent@** (a Datasec wrap reached the other seat) — now seat-aware, refuses an unknown seat, 3 arms proven, claimed with Wednesday. **Guard 74 in the gate-5 launcher** corrected (it missed a parameterised `closeBrowser`), red-proofed. **Rung-10 ghost tap** at NexusAI-I caught by the seat; ledgered.

## 🟢 DELTA 70 — 2026-09-23 05:0x (s81, ctx ~75%). **READ THIS, THEN 69. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### VISION — gate 5 done, gate 6 running
- **QQ main = d4426f8** (CF5R2 cfe85d3 then A9 via 562ab94; both verified at source; toolVersion 2.33 and test:print's 6 files checked on merged main). **Portal main = 6f197ca** (unmoved). Nothing deployed; live QQ still v2.30.
- **%51 GATE 6**: IO1R2 992da21 (tier 1, round 2 of 2: F1 + O2 serverError-not-imported incl. the UNAUTHENTICATED /api/feedback/summary + O3 pool.on('error')) · BCR2 f8dec9c (round 2 of 2; STALE BASE — PDF identity measured against 3bfbfa2, vs-main as a control showing exactly A9's delta). **On the verdict: merge GOs (BCR2 needs a forward merge), then ONE Kam update: amend `quickquote-publish-51e9286-price-fix` to the then-main + pack v5.**
- 🔴 **NEW MERGE-ORDER FACT for Kam's S-1 card:** S-1 89af8ba sits on the PRE-I10 portal base and its errors.js DELETES lastResortHandler — it overlaps IO1R2 in four files. If Kam rules S-1 = a, it is REBASED onto the post-IO1 main, never merged as it stands.

### NEXUSAI — gate 7 r2 on its last leg; gate 8 filling
- **%50 gate 7 r2** holds the jest lock (hold3, evidence 04:54). **On GO:** S80I merges RD-645 (+RD-641) with C-68 + C-142 → post the new main + §5.1 image commands to Kam (card `nexusai-220-image-build-timing`) → new lane-C seat from HANDOVER-S78G → package gate → **ZIP to kamil.kreiser@datasec.com.au**.
- **GATE 8 (lane A, batched) so far:** RD-531+497 d7d6e7e · RD-616+617 r2 cc9616b (the narrow re-gate, round 2 of 2). Joining as their proofs land: RD-438 r2 (CTRL-RAW fixed 1ae1dfd), RD-638, RD-631 re-proof, RD-510 r2.
- S80I: standing C-141 yield (used 3x), HANDOVER-S80I.md carries the merge recipe, no context warning.

## 🟢 DELTA 69 — 2026-09-23 03:0x (s81, ctx 70% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **READ THIS, THEN 68/67. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### ⏳ OPEN DEADLINES
- **24 Sep: Partner Center previously-published packages** — on Kam's live board since 00:2x (201), no reply. Default: nothing more; after 24 Sep, close-by-date.

### RUNNING
- **%49 GATE 5 (Vision)**: A9 5d787d2 · CF5R2 309e6c7 (round 2 of 2) · IO1 a83140e (portal, t1) · BC aa89010. Verdict -> merge GOs (A9 forward merge onto QQ main 3bfbfa2; toolVersion + test:print conflicts expected) -> ONE Kam update: amend card `quickquote-publish-51e9286-price-fix` to the then-main + pack v5 (CF5-F3 wording; the retrying-office lockout trade; I10-O1 live-portal crash; the 3 HIGHs as decision-14 evidence).
- **%50 GATE 7 ROUND 2 (NexusAI)**: A = RD-645 r2 a1b524a (t1, last round), B = RD-641 (i) ab54de1 (t2). Holds the jest lock (hold1: full verify A at 16:57Z); hold2 next. **No limiter-evasion table by Tuesday's scoping (classifier stops); RD-651.** Ruled: NET_ADMIN dummy interface in --network none OK; rd516/rd645 Linux server legs NOT RUN (no offline sqlite3 binding) -> RD-641's rd516-on-Linux claim is measured by CI on the merged head (C-142). **On GO: S80I merges RD-645 (+ RD-641) with C-68 + C-142 -> post the new main + §5.1 image commands to Kam (card `nexusai-220-image-build-timing`, rec b) -> new lane-C seat from HANDOVER-S78G for digest/build/package gate -> ZIP to kamil.kreiser@datasec.com.au.** On NO-GO (cap reached): ship the closed parts, ticket the rest (C-62).
- **%44 NexusAI-I (S80I)**: standing C-141 yield to every qa-gate7r2-* ticket until the verdict. Queue: rd616r2, rd638, rd631-reproof, rd510r2, rd438r2 (RD-438's CTRL-RAW fixed @ 1ae1dfd). **RD-531+497 READY @ d7d6e7e -> GATE 8** (batch with the rest as READYs land).
- **%41 Vision**: idle by design, waiting on gate 5.

### KAM
- Quiet since 18:09 yesterday (live board 03:04). 4 open Datasec cards, all with defaults. Reconcile: nothing.

## 🟢 DELTA 68 — 2026-09-23 00:3x (s81 rotation boot, ctx 53% after the whole load). **READ THIS, THEN 67. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### ⏳ OPEN DEADLINES (re-state in every delta until closed)
- **24 Sep (TOMORROW): Partner Center stops serving previously published NexusAI packages.** Handed to Kam 09-18 and dropped for 5 days (ledger 2026-09-23). Re-raised on the live board 00:2x (201) with the route. Local copies of our own built 2.1.0/2.1.1 zips + SHA256SUMS exist in NexusAI `evidence-s62-published-packages/`. Chrome on the mini still refuses AppleEvents (never script System Events). **Default if he is silent: nothing more; after 24 Sep, record the loss as closed-by-date.**

### NEXUSAI
- RD-651 = gate-7 F-2 (VM compose no proxy hop), filed by S80I 14:20Z. **Closes DELTA 67's "ticket key owed".**
- **RD-645 round 2 BUILT @ 823c7fe** (S80I 14:24Z), proof queued behind its RD-641 hold. **On its READY: gate 7 round 2** (the last round under the cap; brief from `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-22_nexusai-gate7-rd645.md` + the round-2 cells). Then DELTA 67's ON-GO chain.

### VISION — GATE 4 DONE 00:39 (see today's note 00:4x)
- MERGE GO sent: N -> FU -> I9 -> Q5 -> portal I10 (each forward-merged, named cells re-run, MERGED mail; **verify each at source**). P5B NOT merged (Kam decision 14). **After the merges: amend card `quickquote-publish-51e9286-price-fix` to the new main + strings, and build Kam pack v5** (CF5-F3 wording + the long-outage lockout trade + I10-O1 live-portal crash, all his).
- **Gate 5** = A-9 5d787d2 + CF5 round 2 (last under the cap) + I10-O1 fix, batched, when their READYs land. Gate 4 pane closed.

### 01:2x UPDATE
- **All 5 gate-4 merges VERIFIED at source:** QQ main **3bfbfa2** (N, FU, I9, Q5; npm audit moderates 3->0, 3 HIGHs remain = P5B's, held on Kam decision 14); portal main **6f197ca** (I10). Nothing deployed.
- **Gate 5 (Vision) waits on READYs:** A-9 5d787d2 (ready) + CF5 round 2 + I10-O1 fix + the bounded browser.close() harness fix. **Then ONE Kam update:** amend `quickquote-publish-51e9286-price-fix` to the then-main + pack v5 (strings from gate 4's mail; CF5-F3 wording; the long-outage lockout trade; I10-O1 live-portal crash; the 3 HIGHs as decision-14 evidence).
- **Gate 7 round 2 (NexusAI) = RD-645 r2 (tier 1, G-3 re-aimed per C-147) + RD-641 (i) @ ab54de1 (tier 2)**, launched on RD-645 r2's READY. RD-652 filed (unset NODE_ENV).

### 02:0x UPDATE
- **GATE 5 RUNNING in %49** ('QA/Vision-gate5'): A9 5d787d2 · CF5R2 309e6c7 (round 2 of 2) · IO1 a83140e (portal, tier 1) · BC aa89010. Brief `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-23_vision-qq-gate5.md`, launcher `launchers/launch_qa_vision_qq_gate5.sh` (guard 74 fixed by Tuesday). **On the verdict:** merge GOs (A9 needs a forward merge onto 3bfbfa2: toolVersion + test:print conflicts expected), then ONE Kam update (publish card amend + pack v5).
- **Gate 7 round 2: drafter #2 finishing** `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-23_nexusai-gate7r2-rd645-rd641.md` + launcher `launch_qa_nexusai_gate7r2_rd645_rd641.sh` + routing line. **RULED: no limiter-evasion table** (classifier stopped drafter #1 and round 1's tester); NOT TESTED by scoping, RD-651 covers it. On its report: read the wrong-at-source list, stamp, --check, launch.

### FLOOR (00:23): %0 tuesday · %41 Vision · %44 NexusAI-I · %48 Vision gate 4 · %3 monitor · %8 bare shell. Poller alive. Kam quiet since 18:09.

## 🔴 DELTA 67 — 2026-09-23 00:1x ROTATION HANDOVER (s80, ctx ~78-80%, safe boundary). **READ THIS FIRST, THEN 66. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS. QUIET HOURS until 06:00: board text only, no voice.**

### ⚡ UPDATE 00:19 (after DELTA 67 was written)
- **GATE 7 = NO-GO on RD-645** (report `Testing Agent MAIN/projects/nexusai/reports/2026-09-22-gate7-rd645/report.md`; pane %47 CLOSED; scored 0.85). F-1: the rd645 test is 0/6 without an ambient SESSION_SECRET (CI has none). The product holds (21st → 429). **ROUND 2 of 2 mailed to S80I:** a test-only secret, cells for G-1..G-4 (C-146 routes / successes count / NODE_ENV unset = 20 / 15-min window), Redis if docker allows, a full verify with no secret; F-2 (the VM compose has no proxy hop) → one Jira ticket, key owed. **On its READY: gate 7 round 2** (re-run the cells, Q1 live probe, the bypass table on loopback; route answers via tuesday-agent@). A second NO-GO ships the closed parts and tickets the rest (C-62). Kam's image card (rec b) still waits on this.
- **NexusAI-G WRAPPED 14:08Z** (scored 0.95; HANDOVER-S78G.md; pane %36 CLOSED). After Kam's image push, brief a NEW lane-C seat from HANDOVER-S78G for the digest, non-draft build and package gate.
- Vision: ITEM 12 = A-9 logo inset commissioned (the last (a) item) → gate 5.

### NEXUSAI — the zip is one image push away
- **main = c0788b1** (C-142 GREEN). **Package line `mkt-release-gate-s78g` @ df70a96 = READY FOR DIGEST** (4070/4070, arm-ttk 49/49 local + Actions; the draft build fails ONLY on the RD-460 digest placeholder at `azure-marketplace/combined/mainTemplate.json:106`). Handover doc `resubmission-handover-s78g` @ dfbd55b, **§5.1 = the 4 image-build commands** (a clean checkout of main, az account set 0c57ab37, `az acr build --registry nexusaireleaseacr --image nexusai:2.2.0 …`, digest read-back). G has STOPPED (the image push is Kam's).
- **Card `nexusai-220-image-build-timing` OPEN with Kam** (rec b: wait for RD-645 → Tuesday posts the exact main commit + §5.1 commands; default: wait, nothing built).
- **GATE 7 (%47, 'QA/NexusAI-gate7') = RD-645 @ 202770e**, first in queue-jest (`qa-gate7-hold1`) now that s78g-regate is done. Brief `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-22_nexusai-gate7-rd645.md`. **Its questions are ANSWERED via tuesday-agent@** (routing line `QA/NexusAI-gate7|tuesday-agent@agentmail.to|no`; subject "[Wednesday -> QA/NexusAI-gate7] ANSWER" + a pointer tap). It had a safety-classifier stop at 22:02; answered 22:42 (authorised loopback QA; measure lead 1 first: **RD-645's production cell sets no SESSION_SECRET and may FAIL in CI**; lead 2: the VM compose with no proxy hop, read-only).
- **ON GATE 7 GO:** S80I merges RD-645 (forward + C-68 + C-142 CI receipt) → verify at source → **post the new main commit + the §5.1 commands to Kam on the board (card b)** → G forward-merges the new main into the package line (C-68) → then after Kam's push: digest, non-draft build, PACKAGE GATE, the ZIP EMAIL to kamil.kreiser@datasec.com.au (DELTA 51). **ON NO-GO:** fix round (cap 2); card a stays open for Kam.
- S80I queue after gate 7: rd641 (RD-641 (i) @ 1bfc265), rd531, rd438, rd616r2, rd638, rd631-reproof, rd510r2 (RD-510 round 2 @ 5c1af17) → **gate 8, batched**.

### VISION / QUICKQUOTE
- QQ main **763269d** (verified: gate-2 + gate-3 GO items merged). Portal main **aeadcc1** (+ S-2 redaction). Nothing deployed.
- **GATE 4 RUNNING in %48** ('QA/Vision-gate4'): N A-6 r2 54a7202 (round 2 of 2), CF5 bfb8210, I9 f2f5f48, I10 515c9f8, Q5 103340c, P5B 0d45100, FU 78aa156. Brief `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-22_vision-qq-gate4.md`. Answers go via tuesday-agent@ ("[Wednesday -> QA/Vision-gate4] ANSWER"). **On the verdict: merge the GOs (merge-forward + named re-runs; I9/I10/Q5/P5B are stale-base), then amend the publish card + Kam pack v5.** P5B = the production runtime (Kam's decision 14): merging it into main puts it in the NEXT publish, so **do NOT merge P5B until Kam decides 14.**
- **Kam cards open:** `quickquote-publish-51e9286-price-fix` (amended to 763269d; ⚠ get his TYPED word for the production deploy), `vision-portal-feedback-report-unauthenticated`, `vision-portal-reminder-push-public-ntfy-topic`, `nexusai-220-image-build-timing`. The pack v4 is on his board.
- Vision seat %41: everything built except A-9 (low value). Its context is high; check the pane and use its handover if it wraps.

### FLOOR at handover
%0 tuesday · %41 Vision · %44 NexusAI-I (holding, queue) · %36 NexusAI-G (stopped, waits on Kam's image) · %47 gate 7 · %48 gate 4 · %3 monitor. The live poller is alive.

### NEXUSAI
- main c0788b1: **C-142 GREEN** (Build 35721186634, Node 24: 31 known, 0 NEW). **G RELAYED + tapped** (the mail took 320 s to reach datasec-nexusai): push the package re-merge after s78g-regate, then **READY FOR DIGEST → commission the PACKAGE GATE**.
- **GATE 7 RUNNING** in `%47` ('QA/NexusAI-gate7'): RD-645 @ 202770e (base aab3bf2). Brief `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-22_nexusai-gate7-rd645.md`. Verdict `[QA/Datasec-NexusAI -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — gate 7: …`. On GO: S80I merges RD-645 (forward + C-68 + C-142) → it rides in the package; else it is a named residual in the zip mail.
- S80I's queue (jest): rd510 running → s78g-regate → rd641 (RD-641 (i) harness fix @ 1bfc265) → rd531, rd438, rd616r2, rd638, rd631-reproof. **Gate 8 = those READYs, batched.**

### VISION / QUICKQUOTE
- **Gate 3 DONE** (5 GO, N NO-GO; report `…/vision/reports/2026-09-22-vision-qq-gate3/report.md`; %46 closed; scored 1.00). **MERGE GO sent:** portal B (S-2 redaction) → f065675; QQ M → C → K → L, merge-forward + named re-runs. **Verify each MERGED at source** (ls-remote, parents, tree identity).
- **C-F5 ruled by Tuesday:** refund only provider-wide failures + a per-source refund cap of 6/h (new branch, gate 4). **N (A-6) round 2 of 2:** N-F1 rate box, N-F2 481-543 px totals, new v2.32 screenshots in a NEW folder.
- **Gate 4 set so far:** item 9 f2f5f48 (error log, no body), item 10 515c9f8 (portal 413), item 5 103340c (qs), 5b (puppeteer 25 + node 22, Kam's decision 14), C-F5, N r2, the follow-ups (K-F1, L-F1, M pins). Draft it from `launch_qa_vision_qq_gate3.sh` (a drafter subagent) once the merges settle.
- **Kam: 3 cards open** (publish QuickQuote 51e9286, the S-1 feedback report, the S-2 ntfy topic) + the pack on his board. **After the gate-3 merges, QQ main moves past 51e9286: update the publish card (amend it) to the new main + the new strings (the budget messages, A-10) when he answers or before, so the pack matches what would ship.** ⚠ A card TAP = my wording: get his TYPED word for a production deploy.

- S80I: RD-645 built @ d05ec22 (C-146 login-only); RD-631 re-proof queued (fixture fix on export-dir-stores-declared-s80i @ 4ff2d45; RD-575 comment 38048). **Gate 7 (lane A: RD-645, RD-631, RD-510, RD-531, RD-438, RD-616r2, RD-638) is commissioned as READYs land.**

### VISION / QUICKQUOTE
- **Gate 2 DONE** (9 GO, 1 NO-GO; report `Testing Agent MAIN/projects/vision/reports/2026-09-22-vision-qq-gate2/report.md`; scored 1.00). **MERGED + verified at source:** portal main f065675 (G integration); QuickQuote main **51e9286** = items 1, 2 and 3, O-1 (the price fix), A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5. Nothing deployed; the live QQ is still v2.30.
- **GATE 3: brief + launcher READY** (`fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-22_vision-qq-gate3.md`, `launchers/launch_qa_vision_qq_gate3.sh`; --check passes to exit 32 = unstamped). **HELD for ONE C commit** (C-F3's second half: a throwing putOtp must refund; + a stronger q3 check; + the derived harness moved into the project). **On C's READY: re-pin row C, stamp the SELF-CHECK (read the drafter's 11-item wrong-at-source list first; it is in the 21:27 note), --check, then `cockpit.sh add 'QA/Vision-gate3' "bash '<launcher>'"`.** Targets: C A-1 round 2, B S-2 @ 479c3a2, K a33f87e, L small sweep 8271099, M D-F1 0ab83e1, N A-6 ac0a8d2.
- **KAM (all 201 on his board):** the decisions + publish pack SENT as a file (`Vision_Sales_Portal/5_Project_History/2026-09-22_kam-decisions-and-publish-pack.md`). Cards open: **`quickquote-publish-51e9286-price-fix`** (rec a: the Vision agent builds, switches, checks; rollback to v0.4.5-tool2.30-d258651) · `vision-portal-feedback-report-unauthenticated` · `vision-portal-reminder-push-public-ntfy-topic`. **⚠ A card TAP on the publish is my wording: for a PRODUCTION deploy get his TYPED "publish QuickQuote" (or DKIM mail) first** (the vision-v230-typed-word precedent). On S-1 = a: launch a short Feedback_System seat (poller.js:43 sends X-Coordinator-Secret).
- S-1 (89af8ba) is GO from gate 2 but NOT merged (it waits on the card, because it breaks the poller in the next deploy).

### FIXED THIS SEAT
- `fleet/inbox_digest.sh`: curl -m 30 (a no-timeout hang + my `| tail` swallowed the gate-2 verdict). **Never pipe inbox_digest through tail/head: redirect to a file and read it whole.**

## 🟢 DELTA 64 — 2026-09-22 19:3x (s80, ctx 50% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **READ THIS, THEN 63. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### NEXUSAI (`%44` NexusAI-I = S80I, lane A)
- H's hung RD-641 trace FREED 09:07Z (docker stop, via its own EXIT trap). H's six proofs re-queued under S80I behind `s80i-merge-rd607`; G's rd643 + rd528-q7b yielded. **H's pane %38 CLOSED.** The queue at 09:08Z: devscripts (running) → s80i-merge-rd607 → H's six → G's two.
- **RD-645 = POST /api/auth/login ONLY** (Tuesday ANSWER 09:1xZ). enforce is a named residual; the READY must state the NAT trade-off (20 per 15 min per IP) and the red-proof arms (429 from attempt 21, 70x401 reverted, a 200 control).
- RD-646/647: told to remove needs-decision under C-145 (CLARIFICATIONS:1510).
- **EXPECT:** RD-607 MERGED (verify at source + CI run id, C-142), then PR #31 MERGED → **post the merged PR link to Kam (promised)** and relay to G (its regate waits for main FINAL). Then RD-645 READY → gate 7 (batched with H's six as they land).

### VISION / QUICKQUOTE (`%41` Vision seat, Kam 18:09 "fix all the quick quote tools")
- **GATE 1 DONE** (report `Testing Agent MAIN/projects/vision/reports/2026-09-22-vision-qq-gate1/report.md`; pane %43 closed; scored 1.00): QQ item 1 bd3e3cf GO · QQ item 2 72f6c0c GO · portal A2 ce01ba9 + D d11eed6 GO **PROBED only** (conditional on merged-tree re-runs) · **C (reopen quote) NO-GO** (the retention claim; fixed at 03a0682, ungated).
- **GO'd 19:37:** QQ merges item 1 then item 2 to main (merge = tests only; deploys manual + Kam's; both CLAUDE.md files checked, no merge rule). Portal: `integration/portal-gate2-2026-09-22` = main + D + A2, full suites, merge AFTER gate 2. C rebase round 2 of 2 (+ its minors), then A-1..A-5 rebased.
- **Sweep (09:14Z):** 45 items: 9 (a), 16 (b), 21 (c). **B-list product questions (B-2..B-13) are HELD to send as ONE batched message with defaults. OWED.**
- **READY, for gate 2:** S-1 portal feedback-report auth @ 89af8ba · S-2 portal reminder-push redaction @ 1c726bb (rebases onto the integration head) · A-1 QQ sign-in budgets @ 8a157bb · A-2 QQ headers @ f6ca31f · A-3 QQ sign-out @ 57b373c · A-4 QQ PDF FX provenance @ 6eb367e · A-5 QQ .dockerignore @ ebbc953. **The QQ heads MOVE with the rebases; pin at launch.**
- **Gate 2 brief + launcher: a drafting subagent is writing them** → `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-22_vision-qq-gate2-s1-s2-a1-a2.md` + `launchers/launch_qa_vision_qq_gate2.sh` (targets A-F + G integration + H C-rerun + I A-5 + slot J O-1). **Launch it once the rebases and the integration branch have READY heads; read the drafter's wrong-at-source list first.** It is not durable until it is on disk; if the files are missing, re-commission.
- **O-1 (MAJOR, pre-existing, customer money):** the PDF/xlsx print LIST service rates instead of typed ones ($2,000/$300h → $2,100/$280h, measured on main 47eb533). **The Vision agent's TOP build item.** Kam told (201); live v2.30 is unmeasured.
- **Kam cards OPEN (both posted 201, with chat pointers):** `vision-portal-feedback-report-unauthenticated` (rec a: fix portal + the Feedback_System poller, gate, Kam publishes; default: build + gate only) · `vision-portal-reminder-push-public-ntfy-topic` (rec c: Kam changes NTFY_TOPIC + redaction published after the gate; default: build + gate only). **If he rules S-1 = a: launch a short Feedback_System seat (poller.js:43 sends X-Coordinator-Secret; the actionProcessor already does).**
- Every live publish (QQ, portal, S-1, S-2, item 4, the 5b node:22 runtime, O-1) = Kam's word after its gate. Name the UI strings in the ask: the "Sign out" / "Sign-out failed — retry" button, the two sign-in-budget messages, the FX provenance line, the reminder push text.

### CHECKPOINT READS 19:38
Kam's newest is 18:09 (nothing since); reconcile: to rule 0; usage 31%; poller alive (pid 81834). Default if Kam stays silent: continue as above; nothing goes live.

## 🔴 DELTA 63 — 2026-09-22 19:0x ROTATION HANDOVER (s79, ctx ~80%, safe boundary). **READ THIS FIRST, THEN 62/61/60. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### NEXUSAI
- **main = af90431** (RD-619 merged, verified: parents 58bb38c + d98271e ← 695ca5a; CI Build 35702776293 NEW none).
- `%44` **NexusAI-I** (successor, lane A, LAUNCHED 18:5x; brief = "BRIEF: SUCCESSOR Datasec/NexusAI-I…"). Its order: RD-607 @ 8fa0791 merge → PR #31 @ a11eb5f merge (**then post the merged PR link to Kam: promised**) → RD-645 (authLimiter NEVER MOUNTED, tier 1) → RD-641 (i) → re-queue H's proofs. **Answer its plan confirmation with a GO + tap** (a new seat always waits for it). Verify each MERGED at source.
- `%38` **H (S79H) WRAPPED 08:53Z, scored 0.95. Its pane is still open ONLY because its `s79h-rd641-trace` held the jest lock. Close it with `pane_close.sh %38` once that ticket is gone from locks/.**
- `%36` **G**: 7 lane-C READYs; queued devscripts, rd643, rd528-q7b. **Its regate (the package re-merge) waits for main to be FINAL after PR #31: relay I's PR #31 MERGED mail to G.**
- **Gate 7 (lane A) is owed** when I's RD-645 READY lands, batched with RD-631/510/531/438/616r2/638 as they come.

### VISION / QUICKQUOTE (Kam 18:09 "start running an agent to fix all the quick quote tools")
- `%41` **Vision seat**: READY items 1 (feedback CC, QQ bd3e3cf + portal ce01ba9), 2 (label 72f6c0c), 3 (reopen quote 642b06b → **follow-up 03a0682**: retention purge + a real forbidden-field cell), 4 (**LIVE portal HTML-injection in reminder mail to customers**, d11eed6), 5 (portal 8 advisories cleared; QQ qs 320a169), **5b (puppeteer-core 25 + node:22 image: a PRODUCTION RUNTIME CHANGE, Kam's to deploy)**.
- `%43` **Vision gate 1 RUNNING** (launcher `fleet/qa-agent/launchers/launch_qa_vision_qq_gate1.sh`, brief `…/briefs/2026-09-22_vision-qq-gate1-feedback-label-reopen.md`): A = item 1, B = item 2, C = item 3 @ 642b06b (**expect a re-run on 03a0682**), D = item 4. Verdict subject `[QA/Datasec-Vision -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — Vision/QuickQuote gate 1: …`. Items 5/5b go to a follow-up gate.
- **Kam's open QQ choices (defaults stated to him):** printed "N HP MFP/SFP devices" (1 yes?), xlsx row (2 yes?), H-suffix quote numbers (keep), re-price at today's FX (default; "freeze the rate" to change), 12-month retention. **Every live publish (QQ, portal, item 4, the 5b runtime) needs Kam's word after its gate.**

### 🔴 OWED FIRST (added 19:0x): the Vision gate's portal legs are NOT RUN (npm cache)
- The gate's QUESTION 09:02Z: `npm ci --offline --ignore-scripts` fails ENOTCACHED for the gated portal lockfiles (ce01ba9 / d11eed6); the first miss is minimatch-5.1.6.tgz; 6 tarballs are missing. So A2 (the portal feedback mail) and **D (the LIVE reminder HTML-injection fix)** will come back with their real-route/Postgres legs NOT RUN. The gate has NO mail route (answer by acting). **Next seat:** run `npm cache add <name>@<exact version>` for exactly the missing lockfile-pinned tarballs (derive the list with `npm ci --offline` in a scratch copy of the gated portal tree), then commission a SMALL follow-up gate for the A2 + D real legs, so D's verdict is complete before Kam is asked to publish it.

### KAM OPEN (defaults stated): "move the cert" (Tuesday's cert on the Studio) · "finish the vault" · the 15:30 QQ "following" item never arrived.

### TRAPS HIT THIS SEAT
- `ls -A dirA dirB` prints headers, so it is never empty (fixed in the Vision launcher; the --check mode exits before that guard).
- A rebase that git calls "all conflicts fixed" can refuse to continue: commit by hand, `rebase --quit`, `branch -f main HEAD`, push; read the autostash first (it was a usage line).
- send_brief refuses "hold" in a subject; relative paths in PROVENANCE are refused ("your own …" fixes it).

## 🟢 DELTA 62 — 2026-09-22 17:1x (s79, ctx 70% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **READ THIS, THEN 61/60. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### GATE 6 = GO/GO/GO (07:02Z; report `Testing Agent MAIN/projects/nexusai/reports/2026-09-22-gate6-rd619-rd607-pr31/report.md`; pane %40 CLOSED, listeners 12 → 12; scored 1.00)
- **RELEASE mailed to H 07:0xZ** (quotes Kam 18:18:12): merge **RD-619 → RD-607 → PR #31** in order, each under C-142. The heads were re-read unmoved (main 58bb38c). **Verify each MERGED at source** (ls-remote, cat-file parents, tree identity). **After PR #31 merges: post the merged link to Kam on the board (promised).**
- **Pre-existing MAJOR F-1 = RD-645: authLimiter NEVER MOUNTED** (70 failed logins → 70×401, no 429). **The NEXT BUILD, tier 1, → gate 7 BEFORE the zip.** Kam was told (201).
- F-2/F-3 = RD-646/647 (Redis-down: the process dies / 500s forever; compose-only, fail closed). **Card `nexusai-redis-down-fail-closed-policy` with Kam** (rec a; default = nothing built until after the resubmission).

### FLOOR
- `%38` **H at 80%**: told to hand over at the NEXT SAFE BOUNDARY (after RD-619's merge lands). HANDOVER-S79H is written (top: remaining RELEASE, RD-645, RD-641 (i), tickets RD-645..650, every queued ticket). **ON H's WRAP MAIL:** score it, `pane_close.sh %38`, then launch the lane-A successor `Datasec/NexusAI-I` (add a routing line `Datasec/NexusAI-I|datasec-nexusai@agentmail.to|no`; a drafter writes the brief from HANDOVER-S79H; send_brief --kind brief; `cockpit.sh add 'Datasec/NexusAI-I' "bash '/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/!CODING/Datasec/NexusAI/Launch_Claude.command'"`; verify rung 5). **The successor must re-queue H's proof tickets** (they die with H's session).
- `%36` **G**: READY RD-526/527/630/529/471/472. Queued: devscripts, rd643, rd528-q7b (behind H's merge ticket). **Its regate (the package re-merge) is WITHDRAWN until main is FINAL after PR #31: relay H's PR #31 MERGED mail to G, then G re-prepares once.**
- Queue order at 17:1x: merge-rd619 → H's 7 → G's 3.

### KAM TODAY (since 60), all receipted
- 13:57 "yes" = Node 24 in CI (C-143 + addendum :1500). 14:24-14:27 cross-configuration: FIXED (the mini's Ornith jobs booted out; the installer fixed by Wednesday; the Studio clean; the 6 live rows HIDDEN by Wednesday). **Open question to him: "move the cert"** (Tuesday's certificate is parked on the Studio); default = no change. 14:27 praise + HP Spark FYI (not yet).
- 15:24 `mini-vault-stale-skills` = a → the inventory showed the skills are CURRENT (the card's premise was wrong); the extranet conflict copy was quarantined out of skills/Current. **Offered "finish the vault"**; default = leave it.
- 15:30 "look at the following regarding the quick quote tool": **the content never arrived** (att=0, no mail). Asked him to paste or forward. **OWED when it lands.**
- The QuickQuote bundle (after the NexusAI round): feedback CC to Tuesday + the old-quote request + John Spears's "Devices (MFPS/SFPS)" (register `projects_index/clarifications_register.md`).

## 🟢 DELTA 61 — 2026-09-22 15:1x (s79, ctx 65% light checkpoint; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **READ THIS, THEN 60. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### STATE
- **main = 58bb38c** (verified); the RD-575→524→615 chain is closed, and C-142 is green at every step (Build 35683749970: NEW none).
- **GATE 6 RUNNING** in pane `%40` ('QA/NexusAI-gate6'): A = RD-619 @ 695ca5a (t2), B = RD-607 @ 8fa0791 (t1, real Redis leg), C = PR #31 @ a11eb5f (t2, Node 24 CI, Kam's yes = C-143 + addendum :1500). Launcher `fleet/qa-agent/launchers/launch_qa_nexusai_gate6_rd619_rd607_pr31.sh`, brief `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-22_nexusai-gate6-rd619-rd607-pr31.md`. Verdict subject `[QA/Datasec-NexusAI -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — gate 6: …`. **The queue was re-ordered at 05:07Z: qa-gate6-hold1/2 run next** (after s78g-rd471).
- **On gate 6's verdict:** GO A/B → H forward-merges A then B onto main with C-68 re-runs + C-142, then merges on Tuesday's GO (C-127, Kam 18:18:12). GO C → merge PR #31 on Tuesday's GO (a .github change, Kam approved C-143); then **post the merged link to Kam on the board** (promised). NO-GO → a fix round (cap 2).
- **G:** READY RD-526, 527, 630, 529; RD-528 (Q7b) + 471/472/listing/devscripts + RD-643 proofs queued; **release-gate re-merge of 58bb38c PREPARED, and its push is cleared** (C-142 met) once s78g-regate is green. The resubmission handover doc DRAFT is @ 1d08560 on resubmission-handover-s78g.
- **H (~72% ctx):** RD-641 (i) the rd516 Linux harness trace is queued; RD-638 (F-A2) and the other lane-A proofs are queued. It will hand over after RD-531's READY. **On its wrap:** score it, close its pane (`pane_close.sh`), and launch the lane-A successor from HANDOVER-S79H (its top items: RD-641 (i), then the queue).
- **Remaining lane-A READYs not yet gated:** RD-631, RD-510, RD-531/497, RD-438, RD-616 r2 (the NARROW re-gate), RD-638. They go to gate 7 as they land (batched).
- **OWED mechanism (NexusAI ticket, post-resubmission):** nexusai-lock.sh should put qa-*/merge-* tickets ahead of waiting builder tickets automatically (4 hand-yields today).

## 🟢 DELTA 60 — 2026-09-22 13:3x (s79, ctx 50% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **READ THIS, THEN 59. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### MAIN NOW
- **main = `f95917f`** (RD-524 r2 merged by H 02:41Z; VERIFIED by Tuesday: parents 4bc4868 + 402a97e, tree 8ab01a0 == 402a97e^{tree}). CI on f95917f (Build 35680313757): 31 failed / 3910, NEW = none vs the known set, HS3 LEFT (2nd pass, flake reading).
- **NEW RULE C-142 (Tuesday's, verified at CLARIFICATIONS:1488):** a merge step is "green" = the local lock verify green AND the new head's CI Build failing set == RD-641's known set BY NAME (`session-tools/s79h/rd641-known-failing-set-982a84f.txt`). A new failing cell = STOP. MERGED receipts quote the CI run id.
- **RD-641 (High, blocker):** main's CI has been RED since bdca588 (rd516 file: 31 cells, CTRL-1 cannot reach the child server on the runner; rd464 HS3 flaky). CI runs Node 20; **the shipped image is node:24-alpine** (Dockerfile:2). H's 3-arm Docker measurement (20-bookworm / 24-bookworm / 24-alpine) is queued as `s79h-rd641-measure`. A pass on 24-alpine means aligning CI to 24 (a .github change, mailed to Tuesday BEFORE push, Kam owns .github). A fail on 24-alpine means driving the product guard without the seam; a difference = a PRODUCT defect and a resubmission blocker, straight to Kam. Kam was told on the live board that the earlier "main is green" was half true (201).

### MERGE CHAIN
- Step 3 **RD-615**: forward-merged; its merge hold `s79h-merge-rd615` HELD the lock at ~13:2x. Pushes when that passes AND main still reads f95917f; then CI set check. **Verify MERGED at source (cat-file parents + tree).**
- **OWED trigger: on RD-615 MERGED → commission G the release-gate re-merge of main into the package line** (picks up server.js:16474, RD-575, RD-524, RD-615). Deliberately not before, to do it once.

### FLOOR
- `%38` **H** (ctx ~71%): merge chain, then RD-641 (next build item), then its queued proofs (rd607, rd631, rd510, rd531, rd438, rd616r2, **RD-638 = F-A2 built @ 0ab8a05**). RD-583 ruled **DEFER with RD-584** (comment 38019). H plans to hand over after RD-531's READY; at its wrap: score, pane_close, launch the lane-A successor from HANDOVER-S79H.
- `%36` **G**: READY: RD-526, RD-527, RD-630 (@ d4c623b, arm-ttk CI workflow). RD-528 green but its READY is HELD on an invalid Q7 arm (Q7b queued). Built + queued: rd529, rd471, rd472, listing, devscripts, **RD-643 lane-C @ 3128227** (setup-check refuses a bad AOAI endpoint, mirrors the app's SOURCED_SUFFIXES). **Resubmission handover doc DRAFT** = `docs/resubmission/2026-09-22_resubmission-handover-for-kam.md` on `resubmission-handover-s78g` @ 1d08560 (this is the body of the zip email). RD-642 (README:382) is parked until after the resubmission. **Commissioned 13:3x: run feedback-sweep.sh now and mail the line** (Kam asked; answer owed to him when it lands).
- **Package-gate flags to carry** (in addition to 57/59's): every scriptContent mutant proven to PARSE before its red counts (G's Q7 lesson); RD-630's trigger list carries the dead `rd-*-s78g` pattern; no red run in Actions; lane-C branches never run CI Build (every lane-C PASS is local); RD-643 three-rule note (wizard = save < setup-check < test policy), residuals 12/13.

### 🔴 OWED TO KAM (13:38:02 live, view=tuesday): feedback tools CC Tuesday + the QuickQuote bundle (verbatim in `projects_index/clarifications_register.md`)
- **Safe form:** (1) when the NexusAI round finishes (the zip emailed), brief a **Vision seat** with ONE QuickQuote bundle: FEEDBACK_NOTIFY also mails tuesday-agent@; the Vision portal's feedback notifies Tuesday; the tester's "pull up an old quote by quote number" request; and **the change Kam will EMAIL (watch tuesday-agent@ for it, receipt it on the board, add it to the bundle)**. A PRIOR-WORK CHECK is the first item. A live QuickQuote/portal deploy is a production change: his "we make this update" covers it, and each is flagged to him when made. (2) NexusAI: G relays his words as a C-number and files ONE post-resubmission RD ticket (commissioned 13:3x). The relay closes on the C-number and the ticket key.
- **MAIN NOW update:** RD-615 MERGED → **main = 58bb38c** (verified by Tuesday: parents f95917f + 472853d, tree 48fd3eb == 472853d^{tree}). The chain is complete. Build 35683749970's C-142 set check is pending (H watches it). **G commissioned to PREPARE the release-gate re-merge of 58bb38c, pushing only after that receipt (Tuesday relays it).**

### 🔴 CROSS-CONFIGURATION (Kam 14:24-14:27, live): fixed on the mini; two halves OWED from Wednesday
- **Found:** com.tuesday.ornith-loop/-night/-receipt armed on the mini (WED_AGENT=tuesday) since 09-16. They posted 20 Ornith rows into chat_tuesday.json (project=Datasec), 6 of them on the LIVE Datasec tab, and 3 KS ids. **Fixed:** `launchctl bootout` of all three; plists kept in ~/Library/LaunchAgents; 0 loaded vs a chatsync control of 1. doctor.sh already skips ornith for tuesday.
- **OWED from Wednesday (mailed 14:2x, coordination):** (1) install_all_jobs.sh must skip ornith-* for SEAT=tuesday (a manual re-run re-arms them today); (2) a reversible HIDE for the 6 live rows (main.py has no such route); (3) a check of the Studio for any Tuesday config. **When she confirms (2), tell Kam the rows are gone.** Also still owed (shared): the Launch_Tuesday week-instruction line that says to keep Ornith running.
- **Kam FYI 14:27:** he is testing an HP Spark NVIDIA machine that may later give Tuesday a local model. "not yet". Nothing to do until he says.
- Leftover `extest` tmux session (pane named 'wednesday', idle bash from the 09-17 arm test) is left in place and was reported to him.

### KAM (live board)
- 13:33 "Do you get feedback from the Nexus AI and Quick Quoting tool as submitted by testers?" + 13:34 a pasted tester conversation (QQ: pull up old quotes by quote number). **Answered 13:3x (201):** no to both. QQ mails each item to FEEDBACK_NOTIFY (him). NexusAI's boot sweep is not reaching Tuesday; G is running it now. Offered: forward QQ mails to tuesday-agent@, and add Tuesday as a notify recipient in the next QQ release (his go, live tool). **OWED: relay G's sweep result to him.** The QQ request is parked in `projects_index/clarifications_register.md` for the next Vision brief.

## 🔴 DELTA 59 — 2026-09-22 11:5x ROTATION HANDOVER (s78, ctx 80%, safe boundary). **READ THIS FIRST, THEN 58/57. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### MAIN NOW
- **main = `4bc4868`** (RD-575 merged 01:50Z by H; VERIFIED by Tuesday: parents 982a84f + 6a32426, tree 5a5d1dc == 6a32426's). Demo still `aae041a` (CI deploy off).

### THE MERGE CHAIN IN FLIGHT (RELEASE mailed 01:48:45Z to H, quoting Kam 18:18:12 + C-127)
1. RD-575 ✅ merged `4bc4868`.
2. **RD-524 r2** — H forward-merged onto 4bc4868; merge ticket `s79h-merge-rd524` is NEXT in the lock (behind G's running rd630). Expect **3910/222**, then MERGED mail. **Verify each MERGED at source** (ls-remote main; parents; tree identity; read-only rev-parse).
3. **RD-615** @ b7fc78f — forward-merge onto post-RD-524 main, re-runs, merge. Same verification.
- **Merge tickets are gate-class under C-141 (+addendum)**: G/H proofs yield to them.

### FLOOR
- `%38` **H** (S79H, claude 29254, ctx ~54%): merges above FIRST; then **RD-616/617 B fix @ ed6f3fc** (M3 owns HOME + RD-624 class fix BUILT) — proof queued → its READY triggers a **NARROW re-gate** (gate 5 §B: ordered pair [auth-gate-fail-closed → rd616] 11/11 proven, rd616 file, full verify) = round 2 of 2. Then **F-A2 export never ends response** (customer-facing; RD-638..640 filed). Built & queued: RD-619 READY @ 695ca5a, RD-607 @ 9de358e, RD-531+497 (run2 queued after VOID run1), RD-510 @ 1b9f175, RD-438 @ 662faca, RD-631 @ 4b685d6 (C-139). Owed from H: RD-583 cost comment. H said it will hand over after RD-531 READY — when it wraps: score, pane_close, launch lane-A successor from HANDOVER-S79H.
- `%36` **G** (S78G, claude 57419), lane C: ALL built. READY: RD-526 @ 1834d31, RD-527 @ 0a01f47; RD-630 (arm-ttk CI, Kam-ruled 09:03, **C-138**) @ 1e217fc — 3 files ADDED only, verified; its proof running; others queued behind merges. **ONE package gate at READY FOR DIGEST** (flags: RD-528 +23 lines must kill each of 6 mutants; C-133 23-id table; DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE §1.5 principle; README:382 deferred; RD-630 red+green arms).
- No gate panes open (gates 4 and 5 scored 0.90 / 1.00 and closed).
- **Next gates to commission:** (a) narrow re-gate RD-616/617 on H's READY; (b) a lane-A batch gate for RD-619 + RD-607 + RD-531/497 + RD-510 + RD-438 + RD-631 as READYs land (tier by item; batch per 09-18 rule; carry the deadline+heartbeat rule, C-141); (c) the package gate at G's READY FOR DIGEST.

### C-NUMBERS THIS SEAT (all verified in CLARIFICATIONS): C-131, C-132, C-133, C-134, C-135, C-136, C-137, C-138 (Kam RD-630), C-139 (declared directory stores), C-140 (Kam RD-413 option B, renumbered from a duplicate), C-141 (+addendum: proofs yield to gate AND merge tickets). Rule to both lanes: take the C-number immediately before writing; re-check after push.

### KAM (live board; available all day today)
- 08:59 check-in answered; 09:03 "put the check into CI" → RD-630 done-ish; 10:32 **"Ornith is a studio agent. not a Datasec workflow"** → learning + memory filed, digests regenerated. Poller alive; **usage chip armed (publish_usage.sh loop pid 33127 — re-arm after reboot)**.
- **For Kam WITH the package (collect, non-blocking):** RD-630 status; template never validated on real Azure; C-124 KV success path; per-user "Request erasure" removed (C-136); RD-583 scope (after H's cost comment); **gate-5 F-B2 guessable machine-id key on App Service + literal MACHINE_ID in deploy-dev.sh**; F-B1 plaintext secrets survive upgrade until a save; **gate-4 F-A1 symlinked store → false "purged" (pre-existing, on main)**.

### OWED (shared tooling, claim with Wednesday)
- pretooluse hook: refuse write verbs by subagents against other repos (ledger w=4 today); the hook also refuses `git -C $T <write>` in MY repo when the path is a variable — use the literal path.
- Launch_Tuesday week-instruction line mentions Ornith → make it seat-aware.
- Brief template standing line: "build the next independent item while a proof waits".
- `stash@{0}` in TUESDAY = one generated usage line (not dropped).

## 🟢 DELTA 58 — 2026-09-22 09:0x (s78, ctx 70% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **READ THIS, THEN 57. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### FLOOR (panes)
- `%36` **G** (lane C): all items built. **READY so far: RD-526 @ 1834d31**; 7 more proofs queued. All go to ONE package gate at READY FOR DIGEST (flags in 57).
- `%38` **H** (lane A): **READY: RD-616+617 @ f0519fd.** Built: RD-619 @ f26c740, RD-607 on it @ 9de358e, RD-531+497 @ 0081b72, RD-583 header fix @ 9c3660a; proofs queued. **Rulings delivered as C-134..C-137** (verified at CLARIFICATIONS :1435-1451). **Owed from H: a C-number for Kam's RD-413 option B** (asked 22:57:44Z); **a written RD-583 cost comment** (after RD-531+497 READY) → Tuesday rules scope (maybe Kam).
- `%37` **gate 4** (RD-575 + RD-524 r2): re-queued (hold3) after its probe stall; verdict pending. On A GO → **H** gets the RD-575 merge GO.
- `%39` **gate 5** (RD-615 @ b7fc78f + RD-616/617 @ f0519fd, tier 1), launched 08:5x; brief `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-22_nexusai-gate5-rd615-rd616.md`. Verdict subject `[QA/Datasec-NexusAI -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — gate 5: …`.
- Merge order: RD-575 → RD-524 (re-forward-merged) → RD-615 / RD-616 (each forward-merged, C-68 cells per gate 5 §6).

### FOR KAM WITH THE PACKAGE (collect; none is blocking)
- RD-630 (arm-ttk in CI: .github owner + Actions spend).
- Template never validated against real Azure (validate script = az write; C-20).
- C-124 Key Vault success path never executed.
- **Per-user "Request erasure" button REMOVED (C-136)** — user-visible, never worked.
- RD-583 scope (https-only AI endpoint rule) if the cost shows customer impact.
- Gate-5 findings likely: guessable App Service machine-id key input; plaintext mail secrets survive upgrade until a save.

### STANDING-LINE CANDIDATE (for the brief template, both seats hit it today)
- "While a proof hold of yours is queued or running, BUILD the next queue item that does not depend on it; send READYs in queue order." (G at 07:2x, H at 08:4x both idled without it.)

## 🟢 DELTA 57 — 2026-09-22 07:5x (s78, ctx 65% light checkpoint; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **READ THIS, THEN 56. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### FLOOR
- `%36` **NexusAI-G** (S78G, claude 57419), lane C. **Every brief item is BUILT** (WIP branches off release-gate `5b6a24f`): RD-526 a973525, RD-527 910c5cf, RD-528 124bcae, RD-529 137cf7f (on 527), RD-471 be6beaf (proves RD-471 was closed by c7f62f2), RD-472 e1450f1 (on 471), the listing folds, and the dev scripts. **8 proof holds are queued; READYs come in queue order.** Rulings this session: C-131, C-133, validate script NOT RUN (az write), HOSTING doc lines annotated (A), RD-528's CI half = (b) with ticket **RD-630**, deploy-dev = (A), and "build while the lock is busy" SUPERSEDES the brief's one-at-a-time line. **Package-gate flags:** RD-528's +23 lines must be shown to kill each of 6 mutants; C-133's 23-id table; DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE under the §1.5 principle; README:382 deferred to RD-526.
- `%38` **NexusAI-H** (S79H, claude 29254), lane A successor (F scored 0.90 and closed). Brief `fleet/briefs_staged/2026-09-22_nexusai_H_laneA_successor.md` (emailService.js GRANTED for RD-616/617; RD-413 option B binds). RD-616+617 built @ cd6cd55, proof queued. **RD-619 first (harness leak, rd395-server-harness.js is lane A's)** @ f26c740, then RD-607 stacked @ 9de358e. Both proofs are queued. **Gate 5 = RD-615 @ b7fc78f + RD-616/617, drafted when H's RD-616 READY lands.** RD-619 + RD-607 go to a later gate.
- `%37` **QA gate 4** (RD-575 @ 6a32426 + RD-524 r2 @ dc8635c). Its probe-a4 stalled about 70 min (0% CPU, silent since 06:42); I tapped it with an observation, and the gate killed its own probe and re-queued its runtime parts as `qa-gate4-hold3`, **LAST in the FIFO (~9 holds ahead)**. The verdict is hours away. On A GO: mail **H** (not F, F has wrapped) the RD-575 merge GO. On B GO: RD-524 forward-merges again onto main-with-RD-575, re-runs the §6.4 cells + A3/A3b leaker-first, then merges.
- The jest lock is the bottleneck: FIFO, no jumping (C-110).

### OWED
- The zip email (DELTA 51). Package gate at G's READY FOR DIGEST; then Kam's 2.2.0 push; then the digest.
- **Items for Kam WITH the package:** RD-630 (arm-ttk CI: .github owner + spend); the template never validated against real Azure (C-20, validate script is an az write); the C-124 Key Vault success path.
- Shared tooling (claim with Wednesday): **pretooluse hook must refuse write verbs (fetch, merge-tree --write-tree…) by subagents against other repos — ledger w=4 today**; the hook also refuses `git -C $T <write>` in my OWN repo when the path is a variable (use the literal path); send_brief's suffixed-seat undelivered gate; the QA routing line.
- `stash@{0}` in TUESDAY holds one generated usage line from a rebase autostash. It was NOT dropped.

## 🟢 DELTA 56 — 2026-09-22 05:4x (s78, session d1cef502, ctx 52% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **READ THIS, THEN 55. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### MAIN NOW
- **main = `982a84f`** (RD-525 merged by F 17:50Z; verified by Tuesday: parents f1319ac + 845af47, tree == 845af47's bb0a6ae). Demo is still `aae041a` (CI deploy off).

### FLOOR (4 panes + monitor)
- `%34` **NexusAI-F** (S77F, claude 94093), lane A. RD-575 READY @ `6a32426` (merge-only). RD-524 r2 READY @ `dc8635c` (3902/3902; the first leaker-first attempt NEVER RAN, `Cannot find module @jest/test-sequencer`; Tuesday caught it via the gate-4 drafter; re-run r2b claims 60/60 clean and A3+A3b red). Next: **RD-615 (F-B1)** proof hold queued; then F-B2 (RD-616), RD-607, RD-583, RD-531+497, RD-510. **Ruled 19:39Z: lane B's three files (customerDataFiles, dataErasure, dataExport) are F's for new work** (C-number owed back).
- `%36` **NexusAI-G** (S78G, claude 57419), **lane C = release gate**. Brief `fleet/briefs_staged/2026-09-22_nexusai_G_laneC_brief.md`. Worktree `worktrees/release-gate-s78g`, branch `mkt-release-gate-s78g` (main f1319ac merged into pkg a643fe1; merged verify 3925/3925). **Two rulings given:** C-131 (RD-625: re-anchor the RD-503 F-7 precondition + README:383-385, Key Vault option removed) — DELIVERED at CLARIFICATIONS:1406; **RD-626: C-57 base-aware accounting YES** (id ACCOUNTED only if merged blob == one parent's AND only that parent changed the file since base; 23 ids listed in the commit msg; C-112 control beside it) — C-number owed back. **Expect: G's release-gate READY**, then RD-526..529, RD-471/472, the listing folds, the registry params, then READY FOR DIGEST (waits on Kam's 2.2.0 push). **The package gate must read G's 23-id table.**
- `%37` **QA gate 4** (`fleet/qa-agent/launchers/launch_qa_nexusai_gate4_rd575_rd524r2.sh`, brief `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-22_nexusai-gate4-rd575-rd524r2.md`): A = RD-575 @ 6a32426 (tier 1, round 1); B = RD-524 round 2 @ dc8635c (narrow, round 2 of 2 under the cap). Verdict subject `[QA/Datasec-NexusAI -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — gate 4: …`. **On A GO → mail F a merge GO for RD-575** (quote Kam 18:18:12, C-127). **On B GO → RD-524 needs ANOTHER forward merge onto main-with-RD-575, re-run the gate-3 §6.4 cells + A3/A3b leaker-first, then merge.** A B NO-GO of the same class = ship nothing, ticket (C-62; a 3rd round is Kam's).
- `%0` tuesday, `%3` fleet-monitor. Lock queue order is the authority on waiting (not the pane).

### DONE THIS SEAT
- NAS first run CHECKED (agent=tuesday, deletions 0, 5 live-churn TUESDAY dirs unlanded); Kam told on the live board (201).
- Lane C launched; gate 4 drafted, pinned, launched.

### OWED (unchanged from 55 unless named)
- The zip email (DELTA 51) — path: G's gates → Kam's 2.2.0 push → digest → package gate → email to kamil.kreiser@datasec.com.au.
- Morning sweep at 06:00+ (Datasec/NexusAI · Vision; skip myPKI/CypherKey/Lead_Bot).
- Shared-tooling items from 55 (merge-tree hook hole; send_brief suffixed-seat gate; QA routing line) — claim with Wednesday first.
- Kam's demo sign-in (asked); card `mini-vault-stale-skills` open.

## 🔴 DELTA 55 — 2026-09-22 03:0x ROTATION HANDOVER (Tuesday ctx ~78-80%, safe boundary). **READ THIS FIRST. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**

### MAIN NOW
- **UPDATE 03:3x: main = `f1319ac` (RD-495 + RD-498 merged, verified tree == `b2358cb`, 3840/3840). F is on the RD-525 forward merge next.** Before that:
- **main was `47be2b0`** (RD-516 merged; verified: tree == `3d9eb97`, 3828/3828). Earlier: RD-604 @ `bdca588`. **Kam's 18:02 card (a) is fulfilled. Kam was told on the board at 02:57 (201).** Demo is still on `aae041a`: CI deploy is off, and a demo redeploy needs a Tuesday GO under C-127 (the manual path, with the rollback rule as on 09-21).

### FLOOR
- `%34` **NexusAI-F** (S77F, launcher 94091 / claude 94093), lane A. It is executing Tuesday's gate-2 GO (mail 14:08Z):
  - **RD-495** (`179bf60`) forward-merged onto `47be2b0`, A's 12 cells re-run, full verify green, then merge.
  - **RD-525** (`792fda0`) the same onto the post-RD-495 main; the counts are the only conflict, and they are regenerated.
  - **RD-575** (`bcb438d`, stacked) forward-merged onto the post-RD-525 main, then a **READY FOR QA**. **Do NOT let it merge before gate 4.**
- **Then F builds, in order:**
  1. **F-B1** (a purge during an in-flight audit flush resurrects entries; epoch-before-rename fix);
  2. **F-B2** (mail secrets PLAINTEXT at rest in machine-id mode, MAJOR, pre-existing);
  3. RD-607 (Redis shared store; keep one client, a prefix per limiter);
  4. RD-583 (re-arm the parked R10i half from `__tests__/helpers/rd583-parked-NOT-RUN/`);
  5. RD-524's merge after gate 3;
  6. RD-531+497, then RD-510 (measured on main: **STALL = no listen by 420 s**; its harness must kill on a deadline), then the rest.
  - **Tickets filed:** RD-607/608/609/610. F-A1..5 are to be bundled. The `bootServer` child-leak ticket is owed by F.
- ✅ **GATE 3 DONE (17:32Z): RD-524 NO-GO on ONE test-isolation defect (rd404 A3, RD-568 class; product claims all MEASURED holding); R10i split/repair GO.** F was commissioned the A3 fix + round-2 READY (after RD-525 merge + RD-575 fwd). **Round 2 = a NARROW gate** (§6.5 of the gate-3 report: rd404 alone, leaker-first in one process, R0, full verify, plus the 41 cells on the forward-merged tree). Gate-3 pane closed. (Old line follows.)
- `%35` **QA gate 3** (`fleet/qa-agent/launchers/launch_qa_nexusai_gate3_rd524_r10i.sh`): A = RD-524+404+441 @ `f422178` (tier 1); B = the R10i split/repair `bef8946..91861ae` (through-code). Verdict subject `[QA/Datasec-NexusAI -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — gate 3: …`. **On a GO for A: mail F a merge GO for RD-524**, forward-merged onto the main of its turn (the counts conflict is expected). **The gate has NO mail route** (`QA/Datasec-NexusAI` is not in `inbox_routing.conf`), so questions from it are answered by acting, not by mail.
- **GATE 4 = RD-575 on its post-RD-525 forward-merged head.** Model it on gate 2's launcher. The gate-2 report §6 lists the cells to re-run (C's 8 + RD-525's E1/E1-R/E2-LIVE/N1/S1/S2/S2-CTL/AB0-2, lists-agree, a redacted-plus-directory coexistence cell).
- **Lane C seat (release gate): launch it NOW that RD-516 is on main.** It owns `azure-marketplace/**`, the packaging scripts, `bicep/` and `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`. Its work is the release-gate merge of main into `mkt-selfcontained-pkg-s64` (`a643fe1`), RD-526/527/528/529, RD-471/472 and the listing folds, up to the digest (which waits on Kam's 2.2.0 image push). The path map is `s76d-path-map` @ `710e875`. The `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` conflict at the release-gate merge is Tuesday's ruling (docs). Brief it like F's: routing line, send_brief `--kind brief`, then `cockpit.sh add 'Datasec/NexusAI-G' "bash '<NexusAI>/Launch_Claude.command'"`.

### RULINGS TUESDAY MADE TONIGHT (all delivered as C-numbers except where noted)
- C-129: move the csp-violations readout.
- C-130 + addendum: split R10i and park the unbuilt half; no gate change, no skip. A declared-skip list was REFUSED as Kam's call (the workspace no-skip rule is in his shared file).
- RD-575's 4-hunk resolution.
- Gate 2's B GO accepted despite F-B1.
- The existing-test derive edit.

### OWED (shared tooling, claim with Wednesday first)
- The pretooluse hook's `merge-tree --write-tree` clause (:105) was evaded by a drafting subagent: find the form it used.
- `send_brief`'s undelivered-ruling check matches only `Datasec/NexusAI`, so suffixed seats skip it.
- `QA/Datasec-NexusAI` needs a routing line or a reply channel.
- NAS first-run check this morning (DELTA 51). Kam's demo sign-in (asked). The zip email (DELTA 51).

## 🟢 DELTA 54 — 2026-09-21 23:1x (ctx 70% checkpoint; band 80-90). **READ THIS, THEN 53. DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS.**
- **Floor:** `%34` **NexusAI-F** (S77F, claude 94093), lane A: RD-604 is DONE on main @ `bdca588`; F is on step 2, forward-merging into RD-516 (counts expected 3828/217), then the conditional RD-516 merge. `%33` **gate 2** (RD-495 @ `179bf60` + RD-525 @ `792fda0`). E has WRAPPED and its pane is closed (HANDOVER-S76E.md).
- **RD-575 READY @ `bcb438d`**, stacked on `792fda0`; delta = 5 lane-B files + counts 3825/218, verified. **GATE 3 = RD-575, plus any lane-A READY that is out, launched when gate 2 ends.** Model it on `fleet/qa-agent/launchers/launch_qa_nexusai_gate2_rd495_rd525_rd575.sh`. Gate 3's scope is RD-575's delta over RD-525 (`792fda0..bcb438d`); RD-525 itself is gate 2's.
- **F's queue after the RD-516 merge:** RD-607 (F-1 Redis store fix; prior work says the single store was DELIBERATE, so the fix keeps one client with a prefix per limiter), then the restart-503 TICKET and the RD-536 privacy comment (handed over from E), then RD-524 onward. RD-608/609 are filed, not built. The C-128 addendum is done.
- **After gate 2's verdict:** a GO → Tuesday mails F a GO per branch (RD-495, then RD-525); each needs a forward merge of the then-current main and named C-68 re-runs.
- **Lane C seat:** after RD-516 lands.
- **Tool traps met tonight:** `cockpit.sh say` takes the NAME; `pane_close.sh` takes the %ID. `send_brief` wants the exact line `SELF-CHECK: re-read end-to-end for contradictions | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`. A gate launcher's expected-files variable is NEWLINE-separated.

### FLOOR (panes)
- `%32` **NexusAI-E (S76E, pid 73275 / claude 73277) = lane B.** RD-525 is DONE at `792fda0`: E's 7 files, then D's lane-A `fef773b` (server.js onPurge) and `792fda0` (counts 3817/217); verify 3817/3817. **RD-575 is being STACKED on RD-525's head** (the two conflict in dataExport.js, 4 hunks; E told 11:1xZ). Its READY will name RD-525 as its base.
- `%33` **QA gate 2** (`fleet/qa-agent/launchers/launch_qa_nexusai_gate2_rd495_rd525_rd575.sh --without-rd575`) covers **RD-495 @ `179bf60` + RD-525 @ `792fda0`**, with separate verdicts. Verdict subject: `[QA/Datasec-NexusAI -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — gate 2: …`. At 21:3x it was in its opening think; **confirm rung 5 at its first real output.**
- **NexusAI-D (S76D) WRAPPED 11:26Z** (HANDOVER-S76D.md). Its pane is closed.
- **SUCCESSOR `Datasec/NexusAI-F` (S77F, lane A): a subagent is drafting the brief** into `fleet/briefs_staged/2026-09-21_nexusai_F_laneA_successor.md` (+ `.subject`). **WHEN IT LANDS:**
  - read it WHOLE;
  - stamp the SELF-CHECK in the exact gate format `SELF-CHECK: re-read end-to-end for contradictions | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, with a separate `Self-check note:` line;
  - add the routing line `Datasec/NexusAI-F|datasec-nexusai@agentmail.to|no` to `fleet/inbox_routing.conf`;
  - run `send_brief.sh --kind brief --to Datasec/NexusAI-F --subject-file … --body-file …`, and verify it at datasec-nexusai@;
  - THEN run `cockpit.sh add 'Datasec/NexusAI-F' "bash '/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/!CODING/Datasec/NexusAI/Launch_Claude.command'"`;
  - verify rung 5 on its pane.
  - **`cockpit.sh say` takes the COCKPIT NAME, never `%NN`.**

### GATE 1 = GO / GO (11:26Z; report `Testing Agent MAIN/projects/nexusai/reports/2026-09-21-rd516-fixround-rd604-batch/report.md`)
- **The merge order that F's brief pre-authorises (C-127):**
  1. RD-604 to main.
  2. C-126 step 3: forward-merge main into RD-516, regenerate AND COMMIT the counts (F-6, expect 3828/217), verify GREEN.
  3. The RD-516 merge, CONDITIONAL on step 3 being GREEN and nothing else incoming.
- **RD-495 and RD-525 merge only on a separate Tuesday GO after gate 2.** Then RD-575 after its own gate.
- **Findings for F:**
  - F-1 MAJOR, pre-existing: in Redis mode, one RedisStore is shared by every limiter (ticket + fix, one store per limiter with its own prefix).
  - F-5: C-128 is false about top-level codes (addendum).
  - F-2: comment wording.
  - F-3 and F-7: tickets.
- **Kam told on the board (201) at 21:3x.**

### 23:1x UPDATE
- **RD-604 is ON MAIN @ `bdca588`** (verified). F is on step 2 (forward merge into RD-516).
- **RD-575 READY @ `bcb438d`** is stacked on RD-525 `792fda0` (verified). **Gate 3 = RD-575 (+ any lane-A READY), to launch when gate 2 (%33) ends.** Model it on gate 2's launcher.
- **E told to WRAP** (lane B complete). Close its pane once its wrap mail and HANDOVER-S76E.md are on disk (`pane_close.sh`).
- **Lane C (release gate) seat:** launch it after RD-516 lands on main.

### OWED
- **The pretooluse hook's `merge-tree --write-tree` clause (`pretooluse_no_cd.sh:105`) was EVADED** by gate-2's drafting subagent. Find the form it used and close the hole (shared tool, claim with Wednesday). Ledger row 2026-09-21.
- `send_brief`'s undelivered-ruling check matches only the exact name `Datasec/NexusAI`, so suffixed seats skip it (shared tool, claim first).
- NAS first-run check tomorrow morning (DELTA 51). Kam's demo sign-in (asked on the board). The zip email (DELTA 51).

## 🟢 DELTA 52 — 2026-09-21 18:2x (s76 rotation boot, ctx 40% after the WHOLE load). **DELTA 51's OWED ZIP STANDS. Read this, then 51.**

### STATE
- **Kam is TRAVELLING.** He reads and types on the live board. `WEEK-INSTRUCTION-TUESDAY.md` is **LIVE**: his 18:02:30 words are in it verbatim, with valid_until **2026-09-27**. That date is a READING. It was stated to him on the board at 18:2x, and his word moves it.
- **Floor:** `%0` tuesday · `%30` **NexusAI-D (S76D, launcher pid 13411)** · `%3` fleet-monitor. The 7 finished panes (%22, %24–%29) were closed through `fleet/cockpit/pane_close.sh`; listeners held at 14 → 14.
- **D is live on RD-585 + RD-541** (proof jest under its tree, plus `gh run watch` on the RD-518 demo deploy). It has live wakes, so do not tap it.

### SENT 08:14:56Z (verified at datasec-nexusai@): ANSWER to D's 07:45Z plan confirmation, which had gone unanswered
- **Q1: RD-463 DONE, no rebuild.** Q2: **RD-505 DONE at `a643fe1`** (package branch `mkt-selfcontained-pkg-s64`, held off main by C-58). Both verified read-only by Tuesday: `merge-base --is-ancestor b0ec4c2 aae041a` = true; `a643fe1` is a commit and not in main. **So the critical path in DELTA 51 is SHORTER: RD-463 and RD-505 are no longer blockers.** D was told to correct C-120 by addendum.
- **Kam's card `nexusai-rd516-merge-two-known-reds` = a** was delivered under RULED BY KAM. **OWED: when D mails the C-number, run `decision_queue.sh rule/--delivered` with that artefact.**
- **Commissioned AFTER RD-541's READY: a PATH MAP** from main `aae041a` to a zip that has passed its package gate. It has three parts: (1) the steps, including the release-gate merge of main into `a643fe1`; (2) each blocking ticket (RD-460, RD-526, RD-450, and anything else) with its state measured today and whether it is Kam-class or agent-actionable; (3) what the zip will NOT prove, starting with C-124, the Key Vault success path. D then starts the agent-actionable items one at a time, each ending at READY FOR QA to Tuesday.

### EXPECT, in order
0000. 🟢 **19:39: THREE SEATS ON NEXUSAI, by measured lane partition** (`s76d-path-map` @ `710e875`, doc `docs/resubmission/2026-09-21_stage2-lane-partition.md`):
  - **`%30` NexusAI-D (S76D, pid 13411) = lane A:** the server.js/jsonStorage/static family, serial. RD-516 merge sequence → RD-495 (measurement first) → RD-524/404/441 → RD-531+497 → RD-510 → RD-438/487/457/492/519/475/520.
  - **`%32` NexusAI-E (S76E) = lane B:** RD-525 then RD-575, touching `customerDataFiles/dataErasure/dataExport` only. Brief `fleet/briefs_staged/2026-09-21_nexusai_E_laneB_brief.md`. It MAILS any jsonStorage/server.js need to Tuesday, and Tuesday routes it to D.
  - **Lane C (release gate) = no seat yet.** Launch it after RD-516 is on main, the same way: routing line, then `send_brief --kind brief`, then `cockpit.sh add 'Datasec/NexusAI-F' "bash '<NexusAI>/Launch_Claude.command'"`.
  - **RD-525 landing plan (OWED trigger):** when E's RD-525 READY lands → mail D the GO to add its ONE server.js-only commit (the `onPurge` audit-buffer registration, `session-tools/s76e/laneA-server-js.diff`) on `rd-525-export-erasure-coverage-s76e` → then gate RD-525 (E's commits + D's) → one merge with AB1/AB2 green. E's existing-test edit is approved.
  - ⚠ **When the batched gate verdict lands, check its ours/foreign method:** its brief carried the old ambiguous ancestry wording. RD-606 = a shared-ancestor counter reads foreign=0 falsely. BRIEF_TEMPLATE is fixed (fourth correction). A zero from the gate counts only if total=0 or a known-foreign pid classified foreign.
  - **Owed tooling fix (shared, claim with Wednesday):** `send_brief`'s undelivered-ruling check matches only the exact name `Datasec/NexusAI`, so suffixed seats skip it.
000. 🟢 **CHECKPOINT 50% (19:1x), newest state:**
  - **Demo is ON main `aae041a`** (revision `nexusaidev-app--0000099`, verified by Tuesday: `/api/health` build 296d7d47bfd716a8 == sha256(aae041a)[:16]). Rollback anchor `nexusai@sha256:6f5a7d2c…c345` (rev 0000098). Settings backup is in NexusAI `4_Credentials/demo-share-backup-2026-09-21-s76d-pre-aae041a/`. **Kam asked on the board to sign in once. A refusal means roll back to the anchor.**
  - **Path map** is `s76d-path-map` @ `b70a532`, and it STAYS on its branch. **Waiting on D's LANE PARTITION of stage 2.** Launch the extra NexusAI seats from it (file-disjoint, identity facts in every row, floor rule clauses). The only Kam step is the 2.2.0 image push, after all fixes land. He has been told it is coming.
  - **Batched gate %31 running.** The verdict leads to the C-126 sequence.
  - The checkpoint reads were clean: Kam's rulings are unchanged (18:02 and 18:18), reconcile has nothing to do, 0 NexusAI cards are undelivered, the poller is alive, and usage is 9%.
00. 🔵 **18:5x STATE:** batched gate RUNNING in pane `%31` (launcher `fleet/qa-agent/launchers/launch_qa_nexusai_rd516_fixround_rd604_batch.sh`; verdict mail subject `[QA/Datasec-NexusAI -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — RD-516 fix round @ b966634 + RD-604 (batched, tier 1/2)`; separate A/B verdicts). **Demo redeploy GO'd** to D (manual path, nexusai-dev-rg, rollback anchor `nexusai@sha256:6f5a7d2c…c345`). **EXPECT D's deploy receipt and TELL KAM on the board** (revision, sign-in measured/UNMEASURED, and that ACR builds cost a few cents, read as covered by "feel free to redeploy"). Tell D: C-126 cites C-128 for RD-604 (wrong ref), and the counts file on RD-516 is stale (the gate rules on it). Then D's PATH MAP.
0. ✅ **RD-585/RD-541 READY @ `b966634` arrived 08:32:56Z and was verified at source.** D is building **RD-604** (the rd423 1 ms timer, test-only, off main). **When RD-604's READY lands: launch ONE batched gate** covering RD-516 `059f0a8..b966634` (RD-541 = a product limiter change, so security tier) plus RD-604 (through-code). Model it on `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-21_nexusai-rd574-round2.md` + its launcher, and re-pin the heads immediately before launch. Then: RD-604 to main, forward merge into RD-516, verify green, RD-516 merge on Tuesday's GO quoting Kam 18:18. Demo auto-deploy is OFF (`CI_DEPLOY_ENABLED`), so a merge deploys nothing; demo sync is D's separate measurement (addendum 08:20Z).
1. (superseded by 0) RD-585/RD-541 **READY FOR QA** from D. Commission the gate, tiered and batched per the 09-18 rule, re-pinned immediately before launch.
2. ✅ **18:18:12 KAM GRANTED IT (live board): merge + demo redeploy are Tuesday's on a gated head "until we have a stable version" — EXPIRING-GRANTS row; quote him in the RELEASE; do NOT ask again.** (Superseded text follows.) After a GO: **RD-516's merge needs a RELEASE.** A merge to main redeploys demo, and this seat's classifier has only accepted that on Kam's TERMINAL word. **He is travelling. Ask on the live board. His reply arrives as a poller tap; whether the classifier accepts it is UNTESTED.** Tell him if it does not. Never route around it.
3. The PATH MAP, then the gated zip, then the **EMAIL to kamil.kreiser@datasec.com.au** (DELTA 51's safe form).

### STILL OWED FROM 51
- The NAS leg's **first run** (23:00 tonight): check it in the morning per 51's list, and tell Kam on the live board.
- Card `mini-vault-stale-skills` is still open with Kam.

## 🔴 DELTA 51 — 2026-09-21 15:25 (background job 4c844a00). **KAM GAVE THIS SEAT A STANDING INSTRUCTION. IT IS AN OWED ACTION, NOT A QUESTION. READ FIRST.**

### 🔴 OWED TO KAM — carry it until it is DONE or HE withdraws it (lesson: kams-instruction-stands-until-he-withdraws-it)
Kam, typed to this seat 2026-09-21 ~15:2x, verbatim: **"It's okay, let's keep working through it and email me the zip when it's ready to upload and resubmit."**
- **THE SAFE FORM, spelled out:** when NexusAI has a Marketplace resubmission package zip that has PASSED its own QA gate, EMAIL IT, attached, to **kamil.kreiser@datasec.com.au** (the Datasec client address, NOT kreiser.org@me.com: lesson where-kam-reads-and-where-datasec-documents-go). The mail says what the zip contains, the commit/sha it was built from, which gates it passed, and every known residual. **We do NOT upload or resubmit in Partner Center. That is his hands.**
- **"keep working through it"** = drive the blockers below, do not wait on them.
- "It's okay" ruled card `nexusai-rd535-premise-no-resubmission-today` = **(a)** at 15:24:01: nothing on the live listing; the fix ships with the resubmission. He declined the warning (b). **Do not re-raise it.**

### 🔴 THE PORTABLE DRIVE'S NAS SYNC — PAUSED BY ME 15:3x; DELTA 49 IS WRONG ABOUT IT, DO NOT RE-ARM FROM IT
Kam asked 15:24 (both tabs): "How's the sync going with the portable drive?" Measured answer:
- **`com.tuesday.nassync` HAS RUN**, on 09-17, 09-18 and 09-19 at 03:30, from THIS mini. DELTA 49 said "never loaded, zero nas_sync_tuesday_* logs", and that was wrong.
- **Why it looked like Wednesday's:** its plist has NO EnvironmentVariables, so `nas_sync.sh:42` `AGENT="${WED_AGENT:-wednesday}"` ran it AS WEDNESDAY. The logs `scheduler/logs/nas_sync_wednesday_2026-09-1{7,8,9}_*` all have headers reading `agent=wednesday workspace=/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD`.
- **So it applied Wednesday's ruled ignore set** (`Datasec TUESDAY …`), the REVERSE of Kam's `nas-shared-folders-owner` ruling ("Tuesday's leg syncs only Datasec and its own tree"). It SKIPPED Datasec and TUESDAY, and walked the shared folders from the T9, which is the copy. **This drive's Datasec work has never been backed up to the NAS.**
- **The 26 deletions of 09-19 are BENIGN:** 23 are `WEDNESDAY/…/fleet/cockpit/state/` flags; the others are a `.night_run.lock`, a `(conflict_on_2026-09-17)` duplicate and a `.pre-0908` backup. All are in `~/.unison/backup` on THE MINI (`backup = Name *`), not on the Studio.
- **"The Studio's leg last completed on the 19th" was wrong** (I told Kam so, then corrected it). Its real status is Wednesday's to measure on the Studio; she was mailed before answering him.
- **ACTION TAKEN:** `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.tuesday.nassync` at 15:3x, so tonight's 23:00 run cannot fire. The plist is kept on disk, with a backup in the job tmp.
- **BLOCKED ON KAM:** card `t9-nas-leg-scope-mechanism`. The engine (`!SYNC FILES/devnas-sync.sh`, Kam's file) only EXCLUDES by name, so "only Datasec + own tree" as exclusions fails OPEN. Recommended (a): a 3-line `DEVNAS_PATHS` passthrough (fails CLOSED). Measured scope with narrow-hard applied: Datasec 108,137 files / 25.35 GiB; TUESDAY 12,397 / 1.13 GiB; vault Datasec 43 files.
- **WHEN HE RULES:** add `WED_AGENT=tuesday` (plus the paths) to the plist, preview, then `launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tuesday.nassync.plist`. **Never re-load the plist as it stands.**
- The case-fold hazard is cleared: the NAS shows `!CODING/Datasec` in the correct case.

### ℹ️ 18:1x — WHO WROTE DELTA 51: a Claude Code BACKGROUND JOB (session 4c844a00), not the pane seat
- Everything in DELTA 51 (and the commits since ~11:50 today) came from a **background-job Tuesday session** running under the Claude daemon (pid 70960), **outside tmux**. At the 80% band it ran `wednesday_rotate.sh --self`, which respawned **pane %0**. That pane held a *separate* Tuesday session; the job itself was never in the pane. **The fresh pane seat (booted ~18:11) now OWNS Tuesday's coordination. The background job stood down at 18:1x and does nothing further.** No dual coordinator.
- The live poller (pid 81834, parent launchd) taps **pane 'tuesday'**, i.e. the pane seat. It survived the respawn.
- A side finding for the floor-count saga: the "claude … up 00:00" processes that carried prompt text had **ppid 70976 (the job's own daemon)**. They were the job's OWN `ps | grep` command lines matching themselves. It is the same argv false positive (RD-591), seen in the coordinator's own tooling.

### 🟢 18:1x — T9 NAS LEG ARMED FOR 23:00 (Kam: `t9-nas-leg-direction` = a, 18:01) + LIVE BOARD PROVEN END-TO-END
- **Armed:** `com.tuesday.nassync` is loaded, with `WED_AGENT=tuesday` and 23:00 confirmed via `launchctl print`.
  - Scope BY PATH: !CODING/Datasec, TUESDAY, Notes (MASTER)/Datasec.
  - **ONE-WAY additive:** `-force <T9> -nodeletion <NAS>`.
  - Credentials, access keys and unison temp folders are excluded.
  - Engine backups: `.pre-0921-1615-devnaspaths` and `.pre-0921-1805-oneway`.
- **OWED — CHECK THE FIRST RUN tomorrow morning:** `2_Project_Files/scheduler/logs/nas_sync_tuesday_*.log` and `state/nas_sync_last_tuesday.txt`. What it should show:
  - **agent=tuesday**
  - **rc=1 is EXPECTED** (~137k NAS-only files skipped, "[CONFLICT] Skipping … nodeletion")
  - **deletions=0**
  - **NOTHING written into the T9** (`git status` in the NexusAI repos unchanged by the sync)
  - The first run pushes ~26 GiB and can run for hours. If it is still running when seats are active, expect some "failed:" paths, which the wrapper's retry handles.
  - Tell Kam on the LIVE board.
- **The live board is proven end-to-end:** Kam's 18:02:06 view=tuesday row decrypted here, and the poller tapped the pane in 24s. **Kam now reads and types on the LIVE dashboard while travelling** ("post it to the live dashboard"). Memory updated.
- Kam ruled `nexusai-rd516-merge-two-known-reds` = **a** (keep holding, fix RD-585/541 first) ON THE LIVE BOARD at 18:02. Recorded locally; **it still has to be landed in NexusAI artefacts, so carry it in the next mail to NexusAI-D** (the RULED BY KAM section).

### 🟢 18:0x — RD-518 IS ON MAIN @ `aae041a` (verified by Tuesday)
- main `aae041a` = parents `16f05ea` + `4230d23` (the gated head). PASS 3797/3797, 216 suites. C-57 applied (the counts file was the ONLY conflict), id superset missing 0. `authEnforcement.js` has 0 diff (RD-594 untouched).
- **C-105's precondition is MET: RD-518's fix is on main.** What remains between main and the resubmission zip:
  - **RD-516** (held; D is fixing RD-585 + RD-541)
  - **RD-463** and **RD-505** (D, after those)
  - **RD-460** (the ACR, Kam's)
  - **the Key Vault success-path real-Azure proof** (C-124, Kam's)
- D (pane %30) is now on RD-585. Main is GREEN: RD-574 + RD-518.

### 🟢 17:4x — RD-518 MERGE RELEASED on Kam's terminal word ("merge RD-518"); a FRESH SEAT is running
- **Kam 17:3x: "It looks like all the agents have stopped. What's the progress like?"** They had: I had left commissionable work waiting on cards. **Restarted:** fresh seat **`Datasec/NexusAI-D` (pane %30, transcript 2aef58e8)**, launched via `cockpit.sh add` with the T9 launcher. **`rotate Datasec/NexusAI` REFUSES on the mini: the launchers.conf entry points at unmounted DevMASTER.** Do not "fix" the registry to a T9 path; it would break the Studio. A routing line was added for -D (7a937e4b1).
- **D's order:** (1) **RD-518 merge FIRST** (RELEASE mail 07:41Z): 4230d23 onto 16f05ea. The ONLY overlap is `scripts/verify-expected-counts.json`, so C-57 applies. It must be fully GREEN, since RD-518 carries no known reds. (2) the batch: **RD-585 + RD-541** (on RD-516's branch, to make it green), then **RD-463**, then **RD-505**. Each gets a READY FOR QA to Tuesday. **Tuesday commissions each gate.**
- **EXPECT from D:** the RD-518 merge report (the pushed sha + the verdict), then READY mails. **An RD-518 merge that goes red → STOP; read it and never re-release blind.**
- Still Kam's: RD-460 (ACR), the Key Vault success-path real-Azure test, cards `nexusai-rd516-merge-two-known-reds` and `t9-nas-leg-direction`.

### 🔴 17:1x — MERGES: RD-574 LANDED (green), RD-516 HELD on 2 known reds — card `nexusai-rd516-merge-two-known-reds`
- **RD-574 is ON MAIN** @ `16f05ea` (parents 60c76d7 + 7728d69), PASS 3773/3773, zero conflicts. Verified independently by Tuesday.
- **RD-516 merge 2 STOPPED by S74 (correctly), NOTHING PUSHED.** The verify on the merged tree reads 3801/3804, 2 failed. The merge itself is exactly the gated tree `18483a0`; §5 is 115/115 green; the dup-const check is clean.
- **The 2 reds:**
  - **R7:** containment green, only the error NAME missing (**RD-585**).
  - **R8:** 2 limiters where 1 is asserted, i.e. MORE protection (**RD-541**, C-106).
  - The arithmetic: 33 on RD-516's branch, minus 31 fixed by RD-574, leaves 2.
- **Tuesday ruled HOLD (C-32):** main stays green. The local merge commit `d0b9cde` stays in S74's worktree, NOT pushed. Reason: a red main makes RD-518's forward merge (resubmission path, C-105), and every later verify, read FAIL.
- **Corrected to Kam:** I had told him they "merge cleanly with all 31 cells passing" and omitted that RD-516 carries 2 owed reds.
- **Card to Kam:** (a) commission RD-585 + RD-541 first (recommended) or (b) land now with the reds. **(b) needs his TERMINAL word** ("land RD-516 with the two reds").
- **RD-518's merge still waits on "merge RD-518".** It does NOT depend on RD-516, so it can land on 16f05ea.

### 🟢 16:3x — NEWEST STATE (supersedes the 65% block where they differ)
- **RD-518 round 3 = 🟢 GO** (06:28Z, report `…/reports/2026-09-21-rd518-4230d23-round3/report.md`). No Blocker, no Major, no 4th round. NexusAI-C told: ticket H-01..H-05, widen RD-596, carry the success-path residual, **DO NOT MERGE**, wrap.
- **RD-518's MERGE WAITS ON KAM'S TERMINAL WORD** ("merge RD-518"): same classifier class as RD-574/516. Asked on the board 16:3x. It goes AFTER RD-574/516 and needs a forward merge (C-68). Send a `RELEASE`-prefixed mail only after he says it.
- 🔴 **RD-518's LARGEST RESIDUAL, per the gate: the Key Vault SUCCESS path has never been executed by anyone.** Only the failure and exposure side is proven. It needs real Azure. Raised to Kam, with an offer to scope where and how. **Do not let the resubmission zip go out without saying so.**
- **RD-574/516 merges RUNNING** (S74; the lock label s74-merge1-verify was seen at 16:1x). Expect two reports.
- **The floor counter is corrected a THIRD time** (9b901d55e): basename(argv[0]) + the entry point ANYWHERE in argv. Q-01 found first-arg matching blind to `node -r <preload> server.js`.
- **T9 NAS leg (card t9-nas-leg-scope-mechanism = a, Kam 16:10):**
  - The engine gained `DEVNAS_PATHS` (backup `.pre-0921-1615-devnaspaths`; `!SYNC FILES` is NOT a git repo).
  - `nas_sync.sh` has a tuesday branch (aa98b478e).
  - The plist has `WED_AGENT=tuesday`.
  - **PREVIEW DONE (16:4x) — DO NOT ARM.**
    - Datasec: T9→NAS 23,331; **NAS-only (would copy INTO T9) 137,309**; NAS-newer 3. TUESDAY is not on the NAS at all.
    - The 137k: 51,021 are one abandoned `.unison.qa-worktrees.*.tmp`; ~65k are old myPKI/CypherKey copies; HPSM and Security Review make up the rest.
    - **The T9→NAS direction would have pushed SECRETS** (msal token caches, service_principal_entries.json, gh hosts.yml, a private .pem, a private deploy key). **Excluded 4_Credentials / 3_Access_Keys / .unison*** (39124c601).
  - **BLOCKED ON KAM: card `t9-nas-leg-direction`**, recommending (a) one-way drive→NAS additive (a `-force <T9> -nodeletion <NAS>`-style opt-in in the engine).
  - **Re-arm ONLY after he rules.** `launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tuesday.nassync.plist` for 23:00. The plist already has WED_AGENT=tuesday.

### 🟢 CHECKPOINT 65% (15:5x) — STATE NOW, newest first
- **RD-518 round 3 READY @ `4230d23`** (NexusAI-C, 05:53Z): G-01 fixed (`role==='admin'`), G-02 covered behaviourally (new `rd518-r3-health-detail-decision.test.js`), BOTH red-proofs fire, 3796/3796. **Its GATE is RUNNING in pane %29** (launcher `launch_qa_nexusai_rd518_round3_4230d23.sh`: guard 22 = exactly 3 files, **guard 25 = authEnforcement.js byte-unchanged, enforcing RD-594's exclusion**). Round 3 is the LAST round Kam authorised: a Major → ticket, and a 4th round is his.
- Checked at commission: the 6 changed lines naming `adminGateRefuses` are ALL COMMENTS (5 in the test header, 1 in server.js). No call site changed.
- **C's C-01 finding, measured:** no consumer of `keyVaultEncryption` / `.detail` in `static/`, so the admin-only fix does not gate setup. **NEW, pre-existing: RD-596** — `/api/health` never serves `keyVaultStatus`, so the first-run KV tile can never read "Connected". It fails safe; out of scope.
- **Kam's two rulings are DELIVERED:** rd518-round3 → **C-121**; nexusai-rd535-premise → **C-120 addendum** (he DECLINED the warning, recorded as a decision). `list ruled --undelivered nexusai-` = 0.
- **The floor counter is now right on C's side:** basename(argv[0]) + a live control that must RISE, built in; a blind counter ABORTS the window. The control reads 2 (an over-count, which is safe). C's first r3 readings were voided and re-run.
- **Live-board poller:** Kam (15:43, via Wednesday) said "Please let Tuesday know to do the same", i.e. keep it armed. **Verified armed at 15:45** (pid 81834, health OK). Wednesday's seat got Kam's first real tap at 15:43. **OWED: confirm when his first real live message to view=tuesday taps this pane.**
- **NEXT when the RD-518 r3 verdict lands:** GO → it joins the merge queue behind RD-574/RD-516 (all still HELD for Kam's terminal word); NO GO with a Major → ticket it, tell Kam a 4th round is his.

### 🟢 MERGE OF RD-574 + RD-516 RELEASED (16:05) — Kam, typed in the Tuesday terminal, verbatim: "merge RD-574 and RD-516"
- `RELEASE` mail sent 06:05Z to datasec-nexusai@ and S74 (%22) tapped, delivery verified. Heads verified unmoved at release: rd-574 `7728d692f156`, rd-516 `aaffbb91a993`, main `60c76d763503`.
- **EXPECT two reports from S74:** RD-574 merged (sha + verdict), THEN RD-516 merged (§5 on the merged tree + the duplicate-const check). Each is a DEMO deploy. **Any STOP from S74 → read it; never re-release blind.**
- The HOLD history below is kept as a record of why it waited. **Do not re-hold.**

#### (history) MERGE OF RD-574 + RD-516 WAS ON HOLD — waiting on KAM's word in the terminal (15:4x)
- **RD-574 round 2 = 🟢 GO** (05:33Z; report `…/reports/2026-09-21-rd574-7728d69-round2/report.md`). RD-516 is unblocked: aaffbb9 + 7728d69 merge clean, 31 cells pass.
- **C-32 gives Tuesday merge + demo-deploy authority, BUT this seat's harness permission classifier REFUSED the tap that delivers the merge-go as a "Production Deploy"**: a merge to main triggers `deploy-demo.yml`. **Do not route around it.**
- Sent: `MERGE GO` (05:4xZ), then **`HOLD — do NOT execute the MERGE GO`** straight after, to datasec-nexusai@. **The HOLD stands until a Tuesday mail with RELEASE in its subject.** A RELEASE needs Kam's explicit word **in the terminal**: a card ruling on the board is not visible to the classifier as his consent.
- Asked Kam on the board: "say 'merge RD-574 and RD-516' in the Tuesday terminal".
- **R2-1 (MAJOR, the fleet's instrument):** the `comm == node` foreign-server counter is BLIND on macOS (comm = the full execPath). BRIEF_TEMPLATE was corrected a second time (c3f5820ae); NexusAI-C (RD-518 r3) got the correction at 15:36 and was told to re-take any readings. The RULE now is: basename(argv[0]) + the script argument + ancestry + a live control before trusting any zero.
- **Kam's "portable drive" (15:24) meant KK_DEV_Local, not the T9.** Wednesday is syncing it and answering him; Kam has been told. The T9 NAS-leg findings stand separately (card `t9-nas-leg-scope-mechanism`).

### THE CRITICAL PATH TO THAT ZIP (C-105: RD-518's fix lands BEFORE the package ships)
1. **RD-518 round 3**: Kam authorised it at 15:16 (card `rd518-round3` = **a**, scoped to G-01/RD-592 + G-02/RD-593). Commissioned to `Datasec/NexusAI-C` (%24) at 15:17; delivered, prompt clear. Then its gate. **RD-594 (adminGateRefuses) is EXCLUDED**: it is C-01's deliberate open window and needs Kam's scope ruling.
2. **RD-574 round 2** @ `7728d69`: gate RUNNING (%28, launcher `launch_qa_nexusai_rd574_round2_7728d69.sh`). RD-516 is blocked on RD-574; RD-574 merges BEFORE RD-516.
3. **Package blockers** (open High/Highest per S74, 03:10Z): **RD-460** (package not self-contained: customers need a Datasec-issued ACR, which may be Kam-class), **RD-463** (build script exits 141, truncates the MANIFEST), **RD-505** (BYO Key Vault cannot deploy). **RD-450** (submission readiness) has not moved since 09-17.
4. Package build → package QA gate → **email the zip (above).**

### LIVE BOARD — Kam can reach this seat from the live site now
- Poller ARMED on the mini, detached: `WED_AGENT=tuesday LIVE_POLL_TAP=…/tools/tap_tuesday.sh fleet/cockpit/live_chat_poll.sh --seat tuesday`. It was pid 81834 at 15:04.
- Watermark SEEDED `2026-09-21T05:04:36.000Z` so his FIRST message is not swallowed as history (the empty-partition bug; Wednesday fixed it in the poller at e8ae8258b).
- **It does not survive a reboot.** Re-arm with the same line, seeding the watermark only if `state/live_chat_polled_through` is absent. Health: `fleet/cockpit/state/live_chat_poll.health`.
- **OWED:** when Kam's first real live message to view=tuesday lands, tell him and Wednesday whether the tap reached the pane.
- The board is one-way for HIS free text until Phase 3; Phase 3 is proven on both machines today.

### STILL KAM'S
- card `mini-vault-stale-skills`: the mini's vault is 7 ahead / 523 behind, and seats here boot on 4 outdated always-loaded skills
- RD-594's scope ruling (not carded; live reachability unmeasured)
- the week instruction for this seat (see DELTA 49)

### DONE TODAY, so nobody redoes it
- RD-535 ruling landed as C-120.
- G-01/G-02/admin-gate filed as RD-592/593/594.
- `_live_board.sh` card path fixed (88895f74c) and 4 cards backfilled.
- The foreign-server count corrected at source: BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md + launcher guard 24 (count by EXECUTABLE, never grep argv; RD-591 c.37901).
- `.claude/jobs/` gitignored: untracked files outside dashboard/data make panel_sync SKIP its rebase, which silently stops chat reaching origin.
- `wake_ack.sh` used on the finished panes %24/%25/%26/%27/%22: no kill needed.


## 🟢 DELTA 50 — 2026-09-21 10:2x (s75, ctx 50% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **STATE SINCE 49. DELTA 49's FLOOR RULE AND RULINGS ALL STAND — read it too, especially the corrected mechanism.**

### 🟢 BOTH OPEN QUESTIONS FROM DELTA 49 ARE SETTLED, AND BOTH THE GOOD WAY
- 🔴 **THE PRE-REGISTERED `rd554` HALT DOES NOT FIRE.** Run 2 on a quiet floor: **`failed=33`** (was 34), and `rd554-restore-r3-conjunction` **PASSED** — 5 passed, 0 failed, R3c `passed`. **So run 1's "anonymous admin takeover of an enforcing deployment" was CONTAMINATION, not a live finding.** 34 → 33 and **the account is COMPLETE with no residue: 31 seam-dependent + R7/R8 deliberate.**
- 🟢 **rd486 IS NOT FLAKY — 10/10 clean on a quiet floor**, N=5 each side, one lock hold, `foreign=0` asserted before every run, against a contaminated probe that had scattered 11/2/1-failed runs across BOTH versions. **RD-591 filed (High).**
- 🔑 **TOGETHER THESE ARE TWO INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATIONS OF THE CONTAMINATION DIAGNOSIS** — two different suites, two different seats, same cause, same disappearance. Worth more than either alone.

### 🟢 RD-516 FIX ROUND IS **READY FOR QA @ `6ad0e2f`** AND ACCEPTED IN FULL
Six items done · F-1 header corrected · **F-2's eight-row table with the refusal body ASSERTED byte-identical, not assumed** · row 4 still wrong and ticketed in four places · **F-4 verified at source** (`totalLimiterMounts: 2` vs expected `1`) · §4 de-trapped with M-R8 marked INVERTED TODAY · §8 NEW-1 text · **RD-588 + RD-589 filed** · **C-number chain closed: C-54 (the RESUBMISSION CHECKLIST) untouched, C-74 recorded not rewritten, C-107 + C-108 written.**
🔴 **GATE DEFERRED AND BATCHED WITH RD-518 — AN ALLOWANCE DECISION, MADE EXPLICITLY.** Gauge **97%**, age 0 min at the moment of deciding. **A gate would be a FOURTH consumer while two seats are on the critical path; a GO changes nothing today because RD-516 cannot merge until the 28 are on main; and the anti-duplication rule favours one gate over both halves of the minimum set.** **%23 asked to WRAP** so its share returns to the seats building. **Put to Kam as a spend call with an explicit offer to switch.**

### THE FLOOR NOW
- **`%22` S74 / RD-574** — **18 of 31 committed** (`5f3341e` preload · `8f7264d` rd464 ×10 · `7200079` rd486 ×8 quiet-floor). **rd545/rd523 PORTED byte-identical, blob hashes matched both sides** (`1330be3a4127`, `1b484c1b940a`). Ran a **PORT-ONLY inertness pair first** (its own addition) and built a **pristine second worktree at `60c76d7` for the BEFORE side** rather than reverting in place. **Now holds the lock on `s74-rd545-rd523-pair`.** Still owes: the locked five-suite re-take, which **discharges the §5(c) 105/105 caveat I owe.**
- **`%23` NexusAI-B** — READY accepted, wrapping.
- **`%24` NexusAI-C / RD-518** — mid-round. **F-01 red-proved by a cell** (`ReferenceError` at `encryptionService.js:385`). **M7 rebuilt as ONE lock hold, THREE runs** (clean / positive control reintroducing the original defect / M7) so M7 cannot anchor its own zero.

### 🔴 TWO CORRECTIONS TO MY OWN EARLIER RECORD — READ BEFORE USING EITHER
1. **THE MECHANISM (DELTA 49 already carries the fix, stated again because it matters):** the exposure is **SEQUENTIAL**, not a same-instant band collision — RD-571 made allocation defensive. **And the fix is NOT "band harder": a stand-in should REJECT AND LOG traffic that cannot prove it belongs to THIS suite.**
2. 🔴 **THE IDLE DISCRIMINATOR I WROTE IN THE LEDGER IS WRONG AS STATED. `pgrep -P <pane_pid>` DOES NOT WORK** — the ancestry is `pane_pid → claude → zsh -c → job`, so a running job is a **great-grandchild** and `-P` returns direct children only. **All three seats read `children=1` while one was holding the lock and running a suite.** ✅ **CORRECT DISCRIMINATOR: take the pid from the lock's `owner` file and each pid in `queue-jest/`, and WALK ITS PARENTS to the pane pid.** The lock files name the pids; the pane tells you nothing. 🔑 **I validated the wrong rule on the one case where a right and a wrong rule agree.**
⚠️ **And a cheap trap: `ps -o command` on an AGENT process prints its ENTIRE launcher prompt (~4K tokens). `cut -c` does not help — it trims WIDTH and the payload is HEIGHT. Use `-o comm`, or `tr -d '\n'` before `cut`.**

### OWED BY ME — none started unless marked
- **§5(c) "105/105" caveat into the gate brief** — waiting on S74's locked five-suite re-take.
- **The BATCHED GATE over RD-516 `6ad0e2f` + RD-518**, when RD-518's round lands.
- **RD-587's fleet half** (`.launch_preflight_last.txt` is per-project last-writer-wins, names no seat/pane/pid).
- **RD-586's fleet half — ✅ DONE**: `board_count.sh` now refuses an UNVALIDATED ZERO unless `BOARD_COUNT_ZERO_OK` attests a positive control; four arms exercised incl. a non-zero regression check; claimed first.
- ✅ **DONE: two `brief-standing-lines.md` sections** — *establish your seat from the process table* and *the floor is shared / a zero needs a control* — both with the evidence-basis convention and what they do NOT cover. Claimed first.
- ✅ **DONE: the NAS leg** — `com.tuesday.nassync` installed and verified at **23:00** (it had NEVER been loaded, 13 days), and the template's hardcoded 03:30 made **per seat** so it cannot collide with Wednesday's. Claimed first.
- **`pane_wake_check.sh` + `wake_watch`'s idle leg need a "is this seat's work in a shared queue?" question** — three false idles today. Shared tooling; claim first.
- **The boot-prompt gap**: `kam_rulings_today.sh` shows PANEL messages; his RULED CARDS live in `decision_queue.sh` and the ritual names only the first.
- **Corpus consolidation** per Kam's ruled (b), proposed for after the resubmission push.

### STILL KAM'S
- 🔴 **THE WEEK INSTRUCTION FOR THIS SEAT.** Asked three times today; **not asked a fourth — he is demonstrably at the panel and typing, just on the other tab, so silence is a choice to respect rather than nag past.** It sits on the Tuesday tab.
- 🔴 **`confirmbigdel = true` in his `devnas` profile** — one line in a file only he owns. `nas_sync.sh` can DETECT a mass deletion and cannot PREVENT one, **and my leg starts running tonight.**
- **Noted, not escalated:** he is active on Wednesday's tab (dashboard build, external hosting, a DEPLOY instruction). **Not mine. I flagged to Wednesday only that two tenant names in it — "Chrysler.org", "Kaiser.org" — read as dictation for `kreiser.org`, because a deploy plus a dictated tenant is where hard rule 4 bites.**

---


## 🔴 DELTA 49 — 2026-09-21 10:0x (s75, ctx ~41% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **THREE SEATS LIVE ON NexusAI AND THE FLOOR RULE IS THE THING TO READ FIRST. Supersedes DELTA 48 on state; 48's rulings stand.**

### 🔴 READ THIS BEFORE YOU TOUCH ANY NUMBER: THE FLOOR RULE (issued 09:5x, accepted by all three seats)
**Three seats on one project share the MACHINE, the PORT SPACE and the NAS — not just files. Two seats each drew a CONFIDENT WRONG CONCLUSION from cross-seat contamination this morning before anyone noticed.**
🔑 **MECHANISM — CORRECTED 2026-09-21 10:0x BY S74 AFTER I RESTATED IT TOO LOOSELY. Carry THIS version, not the band-collision one.** `reservePort()` does band by `JEST_WORKER_ID` (BAND_BASE 39000, BAND_SIZE 40, start = 39000 + (ID-1)*40, and `--runInBand` leaves the variable unset so it defaults to 1). **But RD-571 already made ALLOCATION defensive: a port is proved free by refusal and then proved bindable BY BINDING IT, so two seats are NOT handed the same port at the same instant.**
🔴 **THE EXPOSURE IS SEQUENTIAL, NOT SIMULTANEOUS:** seat A's stand-in binds P → seat A's server is told to dial P → **seat A's suite ends and releases P** → seat B legitimately binds P → **and anything of seat A's still dialling P (an in-flight request, a scheduler, or a LEAKED server) now lands on seat B's stand-in.** Per **RD-533 that leaked server never listens and raises no `EADDRINUSE`**, which removes the one signal that would have caught it.
🔑 **SO THE FIX IS NOT "BAND HARDER".** It is that **a stand-in should REJECT AND LOG traffic that cannot prove it belongs to THIS suite** — turning silent contamination into a loud attributable error. **RD-591 (High) carries all of it.**
**THE FOUR CLAUSES, in force for every seat AND every gate:**
1. **Every jest invocation through `session-tools/nexusai-lock.sh`** — probes, single suites, `--runInBand`, scratchpad scripts, gates.
2. **Hold the lock ONCE across a multi-run measurement** — a server leaked BETWEEN runs contaminates as well as one during them.
3. **Record the foreign `backend/server.js` count beside every result, by `ps` across all worktrees — NEVER by `EADDRINUSE`.**
4. 🔑 **A ZERO IS ONLY REPORTABLE IF A CONTROL FIRED IN THE SAME WINDOW.** Clause 4 governs **ZEROS, not every number** — a contended floor REMOVES evidence, it does not FABRICATE a named exception at a named line (NexusAI-C's distinction, and it is the right one).
⚠️ **ON A LOCKED FLOOR, THE LOCK'S QUEUE IS THE AUTHORITY ON WHETHER A SEAT IS WAITING — never the pane.** `pane_wake_check.sh` returned **NO WAKE — a tap is required** for all three seats while all three were correctly queued; obeying it would have broken the first clean window of the day. **Use one whole-floor `ps` + `session-tools/locks/queue-jest`.** Both false idles ACKED with `wake_ack.sh`, not tapped.

### 🟢 THE TIER-1 VERDICT SURVIVES THIS — and the reasoning matters, do not re-derive it
A refusal battery's hazard is the OPPOSITE of a fixture suite's: **a stand-in that FAILED TO BIND reports "0 dials" as a FALSE ZERO**, which is exactly what a port-band collision produces. **It survives because the gate ran a positive control that REPRODUCED THE ORIGINAL DEFECT IN THE SAME WINDOW — 200, six dials, both verbs carrying the api-key — and re-ran it LAST as well as first.** A control that fires proves the listener could receive, so the 26 zeros are anchored to a non-zero.
⚠️ **WHAT DOES NOT SURVIVE: §5(c)'s "105/105 on main" — one run, no anchoring control, contended floor. OWED: the caveat into the gate brief §5(c), once the locked re-run gives a clean number.** Walked back to Kam on the panel already.

### THE THREE SEATS — all measuring under the lock
- **`%22` `Datasec/NexusAI` = S74 / RD-574** (pid 66590, 08:57:36). **Preload `5f3341e` committed byte-identical (hash-verified, no run involved). rd464 `8f7264d` committed** (30/30 both sides, empty diff, seam proven load-bearing BOTH ways) — **its numbers are to be RE-TAKEN under the lock.** rd486 edited, NOT committed. **The locked N=5 probe is running now and HOLDS the lock.** Then rd545/rd523 — **all 31 per the (b) ruling.**
- **`%23` `Datasec/NexusAI-B` = RD-516 fix round** (pid 87099, 09:10:47). **Branch pushed `6ad0e2f`.** F-2 done and proven on 8 inputs; **C-107 + C-108 written; RD-588 + RD-589 filed; fixtures dropped (sixth item).** Full verify run 1 = **FAIL, and that is the EXPECTED state** — 31 seam-dependent + R7/R8 deliberate = 33 of 34 by design. **Run 2 queued on a quiet floor.**
- **`%24` `Datasec/NexusAI-C` = RD-518 round 2** (pid 90270, 09:11:56). **F-01 RED-PROVED by a cell** (`ReferenceError` at `encryptionService.js:385`, R7+R8) rather than asserted from the report; hoist deliberately not yet applied. **M7 rebuilt as ONE lock hold, THREE runs** (clean / positive control reintroducing the original defect / M7) so M7 cannot anchor its own zero. **Its redproof2 is queued.**

### 🔴 PRE-REGISTERED HALT — THE ONE THING THAT COULD CHANGE THE DAY
**%23's 34th failure was `rd554 R3c`, which failed on its INSTRUMENT PRECONDITION, not its subject** — the cell refused to report a pass it could not earn. **But what it MEASURED was a supposedly-ENFORCING deployment serving the dashboard and `/api/stats` anonymously and letting an anonymous caller CREATE ADMIN USER ID 1.**
🔑 **On a contended floor that is the cell reaching a server it did not stand up. On a QUIET floor it is an anonymous admin takeover of an enforcing deployment, measured — RD-554's own subject, RD-558's class.** **Two readings, ONE output, separated ONLY by the floor.**
🔴 **RULED BEFORE RUN 2 SO IT CANNOT BE FITTED AFTERWARDS: if `rd554 R3c` REPRODUCES ON A QUIET FLOOR, THE SEAT HALTS AND MAILS ME — it does NOT fold it into the READY as a known-red.** Also told it to record the floor state for **rd554's WINDOW specifically** — a 979 s run with a foreign server alive for 40 s is clean or dirty depending entirely on when those 40 s fell.

### KAM TODAY
- **08:31 undici card ruled (c)** — ship without pinning; already in force, nothing redone. **Delivered.**
- **~08:32 the marketplace deployment count is RELEASED** — *"would have all been testers"*. Partner Center no longer chased.
- **09:16 RD-535 ruled (a)** — ship the fix in today's resubmission, change nothing on the live listing. **Recorded via `decision_queue.sh rule`; NOT marked delivered — it is in no artefact yet and no seat owns RD-535.** ✅ **Checked against RD-549, which RD-535's own BLUF says supersedes it: RD-549 was ruled (b) on 09-18 and DELIVERED (C-79 + comment 37803). The two AGREE — nothing for him to re-decide.**
- 🔑 **FRAMING TO CARRY: the resubmission is the agreed REMEDIATION for a measured live data-exfiltration finding (RD-549), not just a release.** That is why the priority is what it is.
- **09:45 asked whether the NAS sync works and runs at night.** Answered by measurement — see below.
- 🔴 **STILL OWED BY KAM: THE WEEK INSTRUCTION FOR THIS SEAT, before he leaves TONIGHT.** `tasks/WEEK-INSTRUCTION-TUESDAY.md` is `status: none`, `valid_until: 2026-09-16`. **Asked three times today with the scope pre-written so he can say yes in one line. Without it this seat STOPS rather than works on an expired grant.**

### 🔴 KAM RULED THE BOOT DIGEST ON 09-20 AND I DID NOT KNOW — READ HIS RULED CARDS, NOT JUST HIS PANEL
**Card `tuesday-boot-digest-outgrew-the-window` was ruled (b) — "keep the whole read, SHRINK THE CORPUS" — at 2026-09-20T16:44, AGAINST the recommended (a).** I reported the digest size to him as a finding 17 hours later.
🔑 **ROOT: `kam_rulings_today.sh` shows his PANEL MESSAGES; his RULED CARDS live in `decision_queue.sh`. The boot ritual names only the first, and I treated it as covering both.** ⚠️ **Its local copy also ran STALE today — it showed newest 09:07 while his 09:16 message sat in my inbox.**
**FIXED IN BEHAVIOUR: `decision_queue.sh list ruled --undelivered` is now part of boot and every checkpoint.** **OWED: raise the boot-prompt gap so the next seat is not told to read one surface.**
⚠️ **LIVE TENSION, put to Kam rather than worked around: until the corpus is consolidated the whole read does NOT fit (127K tokens, ~70% at boot), so every seat improvising an index read is working against his ruling, silently.** Consolidation proposed AFTER the resubmission push.

### 🟢 NAS SYNC — ANSWERED BY MEASUREMENT, AND MY HALF HAD NEVER RUN
- **`com.tuesday.nassync` was NEVER LOADED. Zero `nas_sync_tuesday_*` logs, ever** — 13 days after Kam's 2026-09-08 14:57 instruction (*"Get Tuesday to sync at 11pm, and I think you should sync at 3 or 4am"*). **Now installed and verified loaded at 23:00; first run tonight.**
- 🔴 **AND THE TEMPLATE WOULD HAVE COLLIDED: `nassync.plist.template` hardcoded `Hour 3 / Minute 30` for EVERY seat and the installer substituted only `@PROJECT_DIR@`/`@SEAT@`/`@HOME@`.** Installing it as-was put Tuesday's leg at the SAME MINUTE as Wednesday's — **two concurrent unison legs on the same NAS replicas with `confirmbigdel = false`.** **Fixed: `@NASHOUR@`/`@NASMIN@` rendered per seat (tuesday 23:00, wednesday 03:30 UNCHANGED). Claimed with Wednesday first** (`0_Brain/fleet/claims/claims_laptop_datasec.md`).
- **Wednesday's leg ran 09-17, 09-18, 09-19 and NOT on the 20th or 21st** — last actual NAS sync was two mornings ago. **All three exited `rc=2`, not 0.** They start 03:30 and finish 15:12 / 08:38 / 11:46 — **they run straight through the working day.**
- ⚠️ **The 09-19 run propagated 26 DELETIONS from the T9** (alarm at 50, so nothing fired); recoverable from `~/.unison/backup` on the Studio.
- 🔴 **ASKED OF KAM, ONE LINE IN A FILE ONLY HE OWNS: set `confirmbigdel = true` in his `devnas` profile.** `nas_sync.sh` can DETECT a mass deletion and cannot PREVENT one. **It was asked before and not done, and it matters more now — he is away and my leg starts tonight.**

### WHAT THE NEXT SEAT DOES, IN ORDER
1. **Read the floor rule above before quoting ANY number.** Check the lock queue, not the panes.
2. **Watch for `rd554 R3c` on %23's run 2.** If it reproduces on a quiet floor — **halt everything and treat it as a live anonymous-takeover finding.**
3. **S74's locked probe result:** if baseline still fails on a quiet floor the rd486 finding STANDS and is stronger; if it stops failing, **the finding is BIGGER and is about isolation, not rd486.** N=5 each side, compare the SET of cells that ever fail; **a SHRINKING set is neither pass nor fail — it lands only with "unexplained" attached.**
4. **Chase the week instruction.** It is the item that stops this seat.
5. **OWED BY ME, none started:** the §5(c) 105/105 caveat into the gate brief · **RD-587's fleet half** (`.launch_preflight_last.txt` is per-project last-writer-wins and names no seat/pane/pid — with 3 seats it cannot be right for more than one) · **RD-586's fleet half** (`jira-query.sh --count` returns a bare `0` exit 0 for unresolvable status names; **`board_count.sh` guards a cap-equals-limit truncation and does NOT guard this**, and I quote board counts to Kam from that family) · **`pane_wake_check.sh` needs a third question — "is this seat's work in a shared queue?"** (shared tooling, claim first) · the boot-prompt ruled-cards gap · the corpus consolidation.

# NEXT PICKUP — Tuesday

---

## 🔴 DELTA 48 — 2026-09-21 08:5x ROTATION HANDOVER (Tuesday ctx 88%, safe boundary: work delegated first). **KAM LIFTED THE USAGE GATE AND NAMED THE PRIORITY. ONE SEAT IS LAUNCHED; TWO MORE ARE READY AND NOT STARTED.**

### HIS WORDS, VERBATIM (panel, 2026-09-21 ~08:3x)
> *"Don't worry about the usage gate. I will log in as a new account as we get close to 100%. Please do everything you can to get Nexus AI ready for resubmission."*
- **Recorded in `tasks/EXPIRING-GRANTS.md`** with its scope and expiry reading: **it lifts the 95% STOP only**, is tied to the ALLOWANCE not the clock, and **is re-asked if he goes quiet AND the gauge crosses ~99% with no new account** (at that point the premise — that he is there to switch — has gone). **The signature classes, the QA gate, and RD-516's own §5 acceptance clause are all UNCHANGED.**
- 🔴 **THE MECHANISM, so the override is visible rather than silent: every launch passes `WED_USAGE_STOP=100`, with his quote as the recorded authority.** The bare gate still refuses at 95% by design — do not edit it.

### 🟢 LAUNCHED — `%22` `Datasec/NexusAI`, the 28 (THE MERGE BLOCKER)
- **Brief sent through the gate and VERIFIED AT DESTINATION `datasec-nexusai@` 2026-09-20T22:57:30Z.** Body: `fleet/briefs_staged/nexusai_rd574_rescue_the_27.md` (content says 28).
- ⚠️ **VERIFY AT RUNG 5 AS YOUR FIRST ACT.** At my last read it was at **rung 4 only** — a turn was running (ctx 7%, doing its git orientation) but the pane had not yet named the commission. **Grep its pane for `RD-574` / `rd516-net-harness-preload` / the suite names before believing it is on the right work.**
- Its scope: test-side only, its own branch off current `main`, carrying the preload helper, acceptance = **INERTNESS per suite**. Six hard stops in the brief including *do not tidy `SEAM_OFF` into the intercept map* and *the seam serves `http://` only*.

### 🔴 TWO MORE, FULLY SPECIFIED, NOT STARTED — **launch both; they are disjoint by file from %22 and from each other**
1. **RD-516's FIX ROUND** on `rd-516-ai-test-ssrf-s73`: the F-1 header correction (the false *"BY CONSTRUCTION"* claim — **RULED: correct it before merge; do NOT widen ai-config here; file the Gov-customer save defect separately**) · the F-2 IPv6 one-liner (`net.isIP(url.hostname.replace(/^\[|\]$/g,''))`) · the F-3/F-4 mutation-table corrections · **and the §8 NEW-1 line S73 deferred to protect the gate's pin.** Touches `backend/services/aiEndpointPolicy.js` + the in-repo brief. **All of it is in DELTA 46 — do not re-derive it.**
2. **RD-518's FIX ROUND, round 2 of 2 (a third is Kam's, C-62):** `fleet/briefs_staged/nexusai_rd518_fix_round2.md`. Touches `backend/server.js`. 🟢 **NOW WIDER than when it was staged: the DEGRADED flip is unblocked** (DELTA 47 — his count release), so the flip is in scope. **Re-read that brief against DELTA 47 before sending it.**

### 🔴 FOUR GATE REFUSALS I HIT GETTING %22 OUT — do not rediscover them
`brief_and_launch.sh` refused four times and each refusal was correct:
1. **No `PROVENANCE:` block** — it wants the literal heading with `- <fact> | <source> | read YYYY-MM-DD` lines, not a prose section.
2. **A slash-bearing phrase read as a relative path** — `spf/dkim/dmarc pass` in a source field trips it. Write **DKIM-verified** instead.
3. **No `SELF-CHECK` attestation** — and running `fleet/self_check_view.sh <body>` **found a REAL contradiction**: the title said 28 while the BLUF said 27. **Do the read; it earns its keep.** Attest with a GENERATED clock (`date`), never a typed one.
4. **No `RULED BY KAM, NOT YET IN AN ARTEFACT` section** — an empty one is valid, an absent one is not.
⚠️ **And `decision_queue.sh --delivered` REFUSED while the repo was behind origin** (*"PULL FIRST… on this file that means losing Kam's rulings"*). **Pull before any card write.** Re-applied after rebasing.

### 🔴 STILL OWED BY KAM — ONE ITEM, AND IT IS TIME-CRITICAL
**A WEEK INSTRUCTION FOR THIS SEAT, before he leaves TONIGHT.** `tasks/WEEK-INSTRUCTION-TUESDAY.md` is `status: none`, `valid_until: 2026-09-16`. **Without one, Datasec has no standing authority for the week and this seat must STOP rather than keep working.** Put to him twice on the panel (08:3x and 08:5x). **Ask again if he has not answered by the time you check.**
**Closed, do not re-ask:** the deployment count (released) · the undici card (ruled (c), already in force) · the usage stop (lifted).

---

## 🟢 DELTA 47 — 2026-09-21 08:3x. **KAM IS BACK AND RULED TWO THINGS. THE DEPLOYMENT COUNT IS RELEASED. TWO ASKS STILL OPEN.**

### HIS WORDS, VERBATIM, both delivered by the panel directly to `tuesday-agent@` (not relayed)
1. **08:31:55** — *"Decision nexusai-rd516-undici-dependency-for-address-pinning: c — Ship WITHOUT pinning; ticket the rebinding window (Recommended - already in force tonight)"*
2. **~08:32** — *"And don't worry how many people have downloaded Nexus AI through the marketplace so far. These would have all been testers."*
3. **~08:30** — *"I answered one ticket. Is there anything else that you need from me?"* and *"Thanks for all the work over the Night."*

### 🟢 (1) THE UNDICI CARD IS RULED (c) — AND IT WAS ALREADY IN FORCE, so nothing is redone
**Ruled + marked `--delivered`.** The artefact it lives in: RD-516 ships layers 0-2 with no pinning (`b2dea38`/`f4264e5`, the tier-1 gate PASSED the security property at 15:02Z); **RD-584** carries the rebinding window with the agent's reasoning and Tuesday's corrected step; **option (2) — undici internals — stays REFUSED PERMANENTLY.** His tap confirmed the recommendation rather than changing anything.

### 🟢 (2) THE DEPLOYMENT COUNT IS RELEASED — STOP CHASING PARTNER CENTER
**This closes the question that gated `nexusai-degraded-flip-and-live-deployments` (ruled (a) 21:14: "tell me the count and I decide from there"). His 08:32 words supersede that requirement: the count is not needed.**
🔴 **TUESDAY'S READING, STATED BACK TO HIM ON THE PANEL FOR CORRECTION — do not harden it without his word:** if the downloads were all testers, **nobody real is flipped to DEGRADED by the Key Vault fix, so the DEGRADED FLIP IS UNBLOCKED.**
⚠️ **The residual, named rather than glossed: a TESTER deployment that is still running WOULD still flip.** So the blast radius is not zero — it is **not customer-facing**, which is a different claim. **He was asked to say if any of those testers is someone he would not want broken.** Until he answers that, treat the flip as unblocked-but-not-zero-risk.
**Consequence for the work: this widens RD-518's fix round to include the DEGRADED flip** — which was the one part of RD-518 held pending his word. **RD-518's round is still PARKED on the usage cut, so this unblocks the DESIGN, not the launch.**

### 🔴 STILL OWED BY KAM — both put to him on the panel at 08:3x
1. 🔴 **A WEEK INSTRUCTION FOR THIS SEAT, before he leaves tonight.** `tasks/WEEK-INSTRUCTION-TUESDAY.md` is `status: none`, `valid_until: 2026-09-16`. **Without one, Datasec has no standing authority for the week and this seat must STOP rather than keep working.** He was told that in those terms and asked to say the words on the Tuesday tab so the scope can be read back before he goes.
2. 🔴 **THE USAGE CALL — this is the live blocker.** `usage_gate.sh` REFUSES at **95% >= 95%** (renews in ~3d 23h) and his lift was scoped to last night. **Nothing Datasec can launch until he lifts it again or signs into the new account he mentioned.** Both next pieces are written and waiting: the RD-516 fix round (DELTA 46) and the 28 test moves (`fleet/briefs_staged/nexusai_rd574_rescue_the_27.md`). **Minutes of work once he says go — do not re-derive either.**

---

## 🔴 DELTA 46 — 2026-09-21 01:0x. **THE TIER-1 VERDICT IS IN. SECURITY PROPERTY CLOSED AND PROVED; THE MERGE IS NOT CLEARED.** Gate scored 1.00, pane %21 done. **No NexusAI seat is live, so THESE RULINGS LIVE HERE — there is no mail to inherit them.**

### THE VERDICT, in the gate's own frame
> **The security property is CLOSED and proved. The branch is NOT CLEARED TO MERGE — its own §5 acceptance clause is unsatisfied, measured. NO READER MAY RECORD THIS AS CLEARING THE MERGE.**
- **26 refusal classes driven anonymously with the gate's OWN driver** (each from its own X-Forwarded-For so the limiter could not answer first; each with a caller key so the key rule could not): **400 on all 26 · 0 dials · 0 contact at a listener bound on the host's real RFC1918 · 0 echo · exactly ONE distinct response body.**
- **The control reproduced the ORIGINAL DEFECT intact in the same window** (sourced NAME → TEST-NET-1: 200, 6 dials, GET **and** POST both carrying the api-key, content echoed into `details.sampleModels`), **re-run LAST as well as first.** So every zero above is a measurement.
- **Absence clause HOLDS:** adapter diff `60c76d7..HEAD` is EMPTY; no `dispatcher`/`setGlobalDispatcher`/`ProxyAgent`/`new Agent`/`fetch:`/`undici`/`axios` anywhere in the branch's backend additions; `AOAI_FETCH_OPTIONS` still `{redirect:'error'}` and **M-R7b proves it load-bearing** (deleting `fetchOptions` reddens R7b + 8 rd523 cells including the containment claim itself).

### 🔴 A FIFTH WAY A ZERO CAN LIE — ADD IT TO §9 AND TO THE BRIEF TEMPLATE'S STANDING LINES
**The gate's FIRST full battery returned 0 dials / no echo on all 29 calls and it THREW IT AWAY.** Every call had been answered **403 `CSRF_INVALID`** and never reached the route — `bootServer` deletes `CSRF_ENFORCE`, so CSRF is enforced and an anonymous caller must first `GET /api/csrf-token`. **It caught this only because its positive control was supposed to be 200 and came back 403.** Its own sentence, and it is the keeper: ***refusal cells alone would have reported a clean pass for a build never exercised.*** (Shared tooling — the standing-lines edit is CLAIMED with Wednesday before touching.)

### 🔴 F-1 (MAJOR) — RULED. **VERIFIED INDEPENDENTLY BY TUESDAY AT SOURCE, not accepted from the report.**
`aiEndpointPolicy.js`'s own header says ai-config's Azure branch *"calls it too, so (C-54) holds BY CONSTRUCTION"*. **Nothing calls it.** Measured at `f4264e5`: the **only** require in the whole backend is `server.js:16580` inside ai-test · `checkEndpointName` has **zero external callers** (its 3 hits are its definition `:180`, its own internal use `:222`, its export `:251`) · **ai-config still runs its inline regex** `^https://[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.openai\.azure\.com/?$` at `server.js:~16414` — **one suffix, https only, no port.**
**Concrete consequence, and it is real: a Gov customer on `cognitiveservices.azure.us` (on the policy's sourced list) can TEST successfully and can NEVER SAVE through the wizard.** Not a security regression — the dial-time policy runs on every ai-test call however the value was stored.
**RULING, three parts:**
1. 🔴 **CORRECT THE HEADER BEFORE MERGE.** A false claim stated as holding *by construction*, in a tier-1 security module's own header, is what the next reviewer will rely on. Cheapest fix, highest value, and it is what gates the merge.
2. 🔴 **DO NOT widen ai-config inside RD-516.** Wiring it changes what a SAVE path accepts (1 suffix → 4, https-only → the policy's rule) — a behaviour change on a different route, needing its own cells and its own gate. **That is scope this ticket was not given, and it is the same shape as the limiter collapse S73 correctly refused.**
3. **FILE IT: the ai-config wiring + the Gov-customer save defect as its own ticket**, citing C-41's "ONE PLACE" as still unachieved (the rule is written twice and can drift — RD-462's shape) and **C-54 as now known-false in BOTH directions and untested.** ⚠️ **C-54 also needs a CLARIFICATIONS correction — supersede, never delete — and that is the PROJECT agent's action, not this seat's.**

### THE OTHER FINDINGS — RULED
- **F-2 (Minor, IPv6):** `http://[::1]/`, `[fc00::1]`, `[::ffff:192.168.8.37]` all audit `HOST_NOT_ON_SOURCED_LIST` instead of their address class, because `new URL().hostname` keeps the brackets and `net.isIP('[::1]')` is 0. **Refusal is still correct in every case (zero dials, identical body) — the loss is purely the operator's audit log**, i.e. exactly the defect this branch just fixed for IPv4. **RULED: FIX IT — one replace, `net.isIP(url.hostname.replace(/^\[|\]$/g,''))`** — and note it makes `unmap()` reachable on that path again.
- **F-3 / F-4 (Minor, the brief's §4 table):** M-R12 reddens **3** cells (R12, R12-provenance, R10ii), not one; **M-R8's direction is INVERTED today** because R8 is already red for RD-541, so deleting a mount takes it red→**GREEN**. **RULED: correct the table.** A later reader applying M-R8, seeing green and recording a failed mutation is a real trap.
- **F-5 (Informational):** the R16 mutant SURVIVES — the Private Link relaxation can gain a fourth conjunct and the whole 31-cell suite is indistinguishable from baseline. **§7 already owned R16 as unwritten; it now has a number on it.** Stays owed.

### 🔴 §5 IS UNSATISFIED AND THE GATE PROVED THE DIRECTION
- **(a) The 28 are NOT on main and CANNOT be as a fixture-only change** — the recipe needs `__tests__/helpers/rd516-net-harness-preload.js`, **absent at `60c76d7`** (as is the policy module). **This CORRECTS my own sequencing ruling: the 28's branch must carry the TEST HELPER TOO** — test-side only, no `backend/` file, still inert. **The staged brief is updated with this.**
- **(b) 27 is exactly right, cell for cell** — four suites on the branch: 27 failed / 78 passed / 105 total = rd464 10 + rd486 8 + rd523 5 + rd545 4. **(+ NEW-1 = 28, classified after the brief was committed.)**
- **(c) THEY PASS ON MAIN — PROVED:** policy neutralised → **105/105 PASS**; policy on → **exactly 27 red. The host policy is the SOLE cause**, and rd464's and rd486's test files are **byte-identical** between `60c76d7` and `f4264e5`, so their 18 failures cannot be blamed on fixture churn.

### WHAT THE NEXT SEAT DOES, IN ORDER
### 🟢 THE FLOOR IS EMPTY — both panes closed, and NEW-1's loop is closed too
- **%20 (S73) closed** after its wrap, scored 0.99. **%21 (the gate) closed** after its verdict, scored 1.00 — *"Crunched for 33m 0s"*, listeners unchanged. **No Datasec seat is live. Nothing is waiting on a seat; everything is waiting on Kam's usage word.**
- 🟢 **NEW-1: the two agents disagreed and the one who READ the file was right.** The gate inferred *"it boots no server, so it's unlikely to be seam-dependent — but unlikely isn't checked"*; **S73 read `ai-config-aoai-save.test.js:62` and found `spawn(process.execPath, [SERVER])` — it DOES run a server, just not through `bootServer`.** So it IS in the set (28), and it needs `RD516_HOSTS` only. **The keeper: an absence of the EXPECTED MECHANISM is not an absence of the BEHAVIOUR** — "no `bootServer` call" was read as "no server", and a direct `spawn` was sitting one line away.

### 🔴 EVERYTHING IN DELTA 46's QUEUE IS PARKED ON THE USAGE CUT — measured 01:06, and BOTH reasons agree
- **`usage_gate.sh --check` → REFUSED rc 3: weekly usage 95% >= 95%** (gauge age 2 min). **No Claude launch can proceed** — not a seat, not a gate, not a drafter.
- **AND Kam's lift of the 95% stop was scoped to "tonight", its own row saying re-ask before Monday. It is Monday 01:06.** So the lift is past its stated scope **and** the gauge is at the cut. **Two independent reasons, same direction — this is not a judgement call and must not be re-derived as one.**
- 🔴 **DO NOT renew the lift by inference.** His words: *"If the credits run out, I'll sign in to a new account in the morning."* **The unblock is HIS — a fresh lift or a new account.** It is item three of the morning report and it is now BLOCKING, not a courtesy re-ask.
- **Nothing is half-done.** The fix round is fully specified below; the 28's brief is staged and re-verifiable. **A successor launches both the moment his word or the gauge allows, with no re-derivation.**
- ⚠️ **Noted not actioned: `usage_gate.sh`'s refusal MESSAGE still says "no new agents at 90%" while the cut it applies is 95%** (Kam's "bump yours to 95%"). **The measurement is right; the message has rotted** — the 2026-08-17 shape. Shared tooling, so claimed with Wednesday before touching.

1. **FIX ROUND (round 2 of 2 — a third is Kam's, C-62)** on `rd-516-ai-test-ssrf-s73`: the F-1 header correction · the F-2 IPv6 one-liner · the F-3/F-4 table corrections · **and the §8 NEW-1 line S73 deferred for the gate's benefit.** Small, well-specified, all on one branch.
2. **THEN the 28** on their own test-side branch, carrying the preload helper, per `fleet/briefs_staged/nexusai_rd574_rescue_the_27.md` (content says 28; **re-verify its RE-VERIFY block first**).
3. **R16 stays owed** with its three conjunct flips; **R3 stays unwritten** and must never be built on the interception seam.
4. **File the ai-config/Gov-customer ticket** per F-1 part 3.

---

## 🟢 DELTA 45 — 2026-09-21 00:2x (s74, ctx 66% LIGHT CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **THE WHOLE FLOOR IN ONE READ. Supersedes DELTA 44's state; 44's RULINGS all stand.**

### 🟢 AMENDED 00:4x — **S73 HAS WRAPPED (scored 0.99, pane %20 CLOSED, listeners 23→23). THE SET IS 28, NOT 27.**
- **S73's wrap read, scored and its pane closed in ONE action** (the 2026-09-15 rule). **Score 0.99** on the scoreboard, with the citation: four self-caught instrument defects before any produced a number · four correct refusals (the C-28 pull, undici internals, collapsing the limiters, editing four unit cells) · four corrections to Tuesday, each landing before anything was built on the wrong version · its own contamination disclosed unprompted · and **a one-line edit to its own brief deliberately DEFERRED because committing would have moved the head the gate was measuring.**
- 🔴 **THE SET IS 28. NEW-1 is IN it, classified BY READING** (`ai-config-aoai-save.test.js:160-161` drives ai-test anonymously at `http://127.0.0.1:${refusing}` and asserts `200`/`azure-openai`; a caller-named loopback literal → `ADDRESS_LOOPBACK` → 400).
  - 🟢 **It needs `RD516_HOSTS` ONLY — no `RD516_INTERCEPT`, no listener, no seam.** Its subject is *which provider was tested*, the port is deliberately refusing, so it already tolerates a failed dial and a refused connection still returns `200 success:false`. **It only needs the endpoint to PASS the policy.**
  - ⚠️ **That suite SPAWNS the server itself** (`spawn(process.execPath, [SERVER])` at `:62`) rather than using `bootServer`, **so the preload is wired as `-r <preload>` in the spawn ARGS, not a `preload:` option.** It will look different from the other four; that is not a mistake.
- 🔴 **ONE-LINE FIX OWED AFTER THE VERDICT: the gate brief's §8 still says NEW-1 is "unclassified".** S73 left it deliberately — committing would have moved the pinned head. **Fix it once the gate reports.**
- **The staged successor brief is UPDATED to 28** with the NEW-1 section: `fleet/briefs_staged/nexusai_rd574_rescue_the_27.md` (filename kept; its content says 28).
- 🟢 **THE PROCESS-OWNERSHIP SCARE WAS TUESDAY'S ERROR, and it is recorded:** Tuesday read a jest in the pinned worktree as S73's and tapped it to STOP. **It was the GATE's own run** — the argv's shell sourced `TUESDAY/4_Credentials/.claude/shell-snapshots/...`, which only the gate has because Tuesday's launcher sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` there. **S73 measured the argv and pushed back in ninety seconds; had it complied it would have been hunting a live tier-1 run.** The instruction (run nothing in that tree) stands; its stated reason is withdrawn. **Confirmed live afterwards by identity: the only jest in that tree sources TUESDAY's creds.**

### 🟢 AMENDED 00:3x — **THE TIER-1 GATE IS LIVE. RD-516 IS AT READY FOR QA.**
- **`%21` `QA/NexusAI-RD516` — TIER 1, round 1 of 2, on `f4264e5`. LAUNCHED 00:3x and verified at RUNG 5** (its pane: *"Commission read. Now the technical subject — the in-repo gate brief."*). Usage gate checked IN-PATH: **94% < 95%, gauge age 0** — so **the gate rests on this seat's standing cut, NOT on Kam's night-scoped lift.**
  - Launcher: **`fleet/qa-agent/launchers/launch_qa_nexusai_rd516_f4264e5.sh`** — DERIVED from the RD-464 one (not hand-written), two-parent guard replaced by a base-ancestor check (the target is a CHAIN of 6), **plus NEW guard 19** (the in-repo brief must be present in the worktree, or the gate improvises a subject) **and NEW guard 20** (the AgentMail key named by ABSOLUTE path — the DELTA 40 defect). **Both red-proofed to their exact exit codes (19, 20) and the pass arm re-run clean after.**
  - Commission: `fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-21_nexusai-rd516-tier1.md` (+ `.prompt.txt`). **It points AT S73's in-repo brief as the technical subject rather than duplicating it.** Verdict comes to `tuesday-agent@`, subject `[QA/Datasec-NexusAI -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — RD-516 @ f4264e5 (tier 1)`; report at `Testing Agent MAIN/projects/nexusai/reports/2026-09-21-rd516-f4264e5-tier1/report.md`.
- **RD-516 → Testing, evidence comment 37887. Full suite at the head: 30 failed · 1 skipped · 3772 passed · 3803 total; 6 suites failed / 209 passed / 215.** **The count validates the named 27 EXACTLY** (27 + R7 + R8 + NEW-1 = 30; 3772+30+1 = 3803 — arithmetic checked by Tuesday). 🟢 **rd486's four UNIT cells are ABSENT from the failing list, which is the proof ruling (b) worked — visible in the number, not in an argument.**
- 🔴 **THE WORKTREE IS EXCLUSIVE TO THE GATE: run NOTHING in `qa-worktrees/s73-rd516` until the verdict lands.** My first instruction said "no commits" and S73 was legitimately RUNNING a suite there thirteen seconds later — **two concurrent jest runs in one tree is shared ports, shared `/tmp` and doubled load, the exact contamination S73 refused to quote a number from earlier.** Caught by `pane_wake_check.sh`'s untruncated output on its first real use; tapped, named as Tuesday's gap. **Nothing lost — a run does not move HEAD and the gate had not reached its suites.**
- 🔴 **R16 is NOT written and is NOT S73's to write now — the reason is the PIN, not the scope.** It needs a commit. **It goes to the successor with the 28.**
- **S73's last items: classify NEW-1 (`ai-config-aoai-save`, 0 boots) as a READ not a run, then WRAP.**
- **STRUCTURAL FIX FOR NEXT TIME: a gate gets its OWN worktree, created by the PROJECT seat as its last act before wrapping.** Wednesday cannot create it — `worktree add` is a write in another project's `.git` and the hook correctly refuses.

### THE FLOOR
- **`%20` `Datasec/NexusAI` (S73) — ctx 65%, round ENDED (READY sent).** Turn ended; **the FULL-SUITE run is live** (`jest --maxWorkers=2` → `$SP/full-FINAL.txt`, pid 53566 at 09:34 elapsed when measured). **That is a LEGITIMATE hold — the pending work IS that run's output — so it was ACKED (`wake_ack.sh %20`), not tapped.** Its next mail is the number, then **READY FOR QA**.
- **`main` = `60c76d7`** (unchanged tonight — none of RD-516 has merged). **Minimum set still RD-516 · RD-518.**
- **Usage 94%.** ⏳ **Kam's lift of the 95% stop was for the NIGHT OF 2026-09-20 ONLY, undated. RE-ASK before treating headroom as granted — it is item three of the morning report.**

### RD-516 — WHERE IT ACTUALLY IS
| piece | head | state |
|---|---|---|
| CHANGE 1 (fixtures, 3 cells) | `f09836d` + `f4ef7a7` | done, inertness pairs EMPTY-diff |
| CHANGE 2 (the policy, provenance out of band, red proof) | `b2dea38` | done |
| The seam + SEAM-2 permanent control + R7 rescued | `315061a` | done |
| R6, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE, **the gate brief** | `4422325`, `f4264e5` | done |
- **28 passed · 2 failed · 1 skipped** at last report. The 2 are **R7 (RD-585, naming only — containment green)** and **R8 (RD-541/C-106, not taken here)**; the skip is **R10(i) (RD-583)**.
- 🔴 **THE DELIVERABLE IS IN GIT, NOT IN THE HANDOVER: `docs/rd516/RD-516-gate-brief.md`, 186 lines at `f4264e5`.** That is the IN-REPO path — the repo root IS `2_Project_Files`, so `git show <sha>:2_Project_Files/docs/...` returns "does not exist" and a successor may wrongly conclude it is uncommitted. **It carries §5 (the acceptance clause), §6 (the named 27 + the proven recipe) and §7 (the honest NOT-TESTED list).**
- **Filed tonight:** RD-583 (§3.3 scheme rule unimplemented) · RD-584 (rebinding window) · RD-585 (R7's unnamed refusal). **Comments:** RD-516 c.37882 + c.37886, RD-583 c.37884, RD-585/RD-584 c.37885.

### 🔴 THE NEXT PIECE IS WRITTEN AND STAGED — DO NOT RE-DERIVE IT
**`2_Project_Files/fleet/briefs_staged/nexusai_rd574_rescue_the_27.md`** (53 lines, committed): rescue the **27** (not 26) seam-dependent cells on their **OWN branch merging BEFORE RD-516**, per §6's four-step recipe, acceptance = **INERTNESS per suite** (before/after at current main, empty per-cell diff). **It opens with a RE-VERIFY block: the heads, §6 at the then-current head, the gauge, and whether any of the 28 were already taken.** Six hard stops in it, including the http-only seam limit and "do not tidy `SEAM_OFF` into the intercept map".
🔴 **DO NOT LAUNCH IT WHILE S73 IS LIVE: the 28 span rd464, rd486, rd523, rd545 and S73's branch holds rd523 + rd545.** The partition forbids it. **It goes to S73's SUCCESSOR after its wrap.**

### OWED TO KAM — and the first one is time-critical because he leaves TONIGHT
1. 🔴 **THE MORNING REPORT, drafted at `5_Project_History/2026-09-21_morning-report-draft.md`** with a RE-VERIFY list. **ITEM ONE IS THE WEEK INSTRUCTION FOR THIS SEAT:** `tasks/WEEK-INSTRUCTION-TUESDAY.md` is `status: none`, `valid_until: 2026-09-16`, and per the unattended-week design **he leaves Monday night 2026-09-21**. **Without one, Datasec has NO standing authority for the week and this seat must stop rather than keep working.** Wednesday's shared copy is now `lapsed` (her seat marked it, correctly).
2. **The deployment count** — ruled (a) 21:14; the answer (it is his, and why, measured) is ON HIS PANEL since 23:02.
3. **The usage re-ask** (see above).
- **Cards open:** `nexusai-rd516-undici-dependency-for-address-pinning` (default **c**, safe, already in force) · `nexusai-degraded-flip-and-live-deployments` (ruled a, awaiting his count) · `nexusai-rd535-live-listing-restore-reopen`.

### 🔴 NINE THINGS NOT TO RE-OPEN
1. The **provenance re-key** (Q2b's TRUSTED-STORED stays) — HELD, measured.
2. **Option (2)**, reaching undici's `Agent` through `Symbol.for(...)` + a prototype walk — **REFUSED PERMANENTLY.**
3. **§3.3's scheme rule** — not narrowed, not implemented; RD-583.
4. **The limiter collapse** inside RD-516 — C-106 says it is not symmetric.
5. **R3 on the interception seam** — it would test the harness against itself.
6. **Rescuing the 28 inside RD-516's branch** — rebuilds the mixed diff the split avoids.
7. **The vault** (`tuesday-mini-vault-three-unpushed-commits`, ruled (a) 16:44: leave it, nothing pushes from the mini).
8. **The Spotlight card** — withdrawn; the measured answer (exclusion absent, index 13.01 GiB, `!CODING` holds 1,802,024 indexed `.js`) is in the morning report.
9. **The decision-records move** — authorised (a) 19:39 but **the move is the PROJECT agent's action, never this seat's**; the gitleaks constraints are in DELTA 42 item 5.

### NEW TOOLING THIS SEAT
**`2_Project_Files/fleet/pane_wake_check.sh`** — `--selftest` (4 arms, all PASS) after the inline wake check failed four ways in one session. **Use it instead of composing a `ps`/glyph check:** `pane_wake_check.sh <pane> <pattern>`, rc 0 = wake pending (mail suffices), rc 3 = tap required. **The glyph arm PROVES `✻` matches the live AND the done marker, so DELTA 43's check is unusable — do not revive it.**

## 🌙 DELTA 44 — 2026-09-20 23:0x (s74 boot; ctx 29% after the WHOLE brain load). **THE HELD QUESTION IS ANSWERED AND RD-574 IS RULED. SUPERSEDES DELTA 43 on the provenance hold and on the tap-rule instrument.**

### THE FLOOR
- **`%20` `Datasec/NexusAI` (S73) — still the ONLY live seat, ctx 46%.** Turn ENDED at 22:48 and again after 12:55Z; **a background jest is running each time (pids rotated 64499 → 95434/95555), which re-invokes it on exit — that is a real wake, so mail sufficed both times.** Branch `8aaafd9`.
- **`main` = `60c76d7`. Minimum set unchanged: RD-516 · RD-518.** RD-518's fix round still staged at `fleet/briefs_staged/nexusai_rd518_fix_round2.md`, **round 2 of 2, a third is Kam's (C-62)**, still queued behind RD-516 (both touch `server.js`).
- **Usage 93%.** Kam lifted the 95% stop **for tonight only, no stated date — RE-ASK BEFORE MONDAY.** Nothing new was launched tonight; nothing needed to be.
- **Linear: 109 active WED issues** (`board_count.sh`, real count, limit 250). **DevMASTER NOT mounted.**

### 🟢 THE PROVENANCE QUESTION IS CLOSED — DELTA 43's COMMISSION IS ANSWERED, AND ITS "UNMEASURED" FLAG IS NOW MEASURED
**S73's ANSWER 12:48:22Z, spf/dkim/dmarc all pass: anonymous CANNOT reach `state: confirmed, mode: admin`.** ARM A (anonymous, open window) confirms to mode `open` and the boot gate REFUSES to promote; ARM B (signed-in admin, enforcing deployment) reaches the promotion on the same path, same detector. **The control fires, so ARM A's negative is a measurement.** It killed two harness faults first — a dead control (`bootServer` seeds into its own mkdtemp while its DATA_DIR override sent the server elsewhere) and a detector reading `ai-model`'s endpoint, empty in BOTH arms because that config is cached before the boot promotion.

🟢 **DELTA 43's honest limit is DISCHARGED, verified by Tuesday at source and not accepted from the mail:** `git grep` at `60c76d7` over `backend`/`scripts`/`static` → **8 writes to `process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_*`, ALL `backend/server.js`, `:4433-4436` and `:4684-4687`**; positive control non-zero in 4 files. **Exactly S73's count; the broken grep was mine, as flagged.** The guard `if (endpoint && !process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT)` reads in the line itself.

🔴 **THE RULING STANDS AND MUST NOT BE RE-OPENED: Q2b's TRUSTED-STORED stays; the provenance re-key is HELD, not adopted.** The measurement removes the failure mode, it does not make the rule correct — **`process.env` cannot distinguish deploy-time from promoted because the promotion writes the same key.** S73's mutual-exclusivity finding (a deploy-time value is never overwritten, so the two origins never coexist) is the load-bearing fact if it is ever revisited and now lives in **RD-582**, not in a mail. **Tuesday did NOT re-run ARM A/ARM B — told S73 so, so nobody cites this seat as having reproduced it.**

### 🔴 RD-574 CHANGE 1 IS RULED — AND S73 REFUTED THE FIXTURE SHAPE THE EARLIER SCOPE RULING RESTED ON
**Measured against `backend/services/aiEndpointPolicy.js`, `dns.promises.lookup` stubbed as the RD-516 preload stubs it:** allowed Azure NAME → **loopback REFUSED on BOTH branches**; → **RFC1918 refused in the OPEN window, allowed only SIGNED-IN + configured**. **One shape survives.** So *"point an allowed NAME at a stand-in"* is NOT buildable for any open-window cell. **rd545's K-live is the clearest instance — its subject IS an anonymous successful dial in the open window.**

**RULED (mailed 12:57:34Z, verified at destination, pointer tapped):**
1. **Build the signed-in/configured half NOW.** Leave every open-window cell untouched and **listed**.
2. **Option 2 (permit loopback) REFUSED.** §3.2 refuses loopback on both branches deliberately; permitting it weakens a security control to make a harness convenient — the trap in its one engineering-shaped costume.
3. **Option 3 (third-value provenance) stays HELD.** The number it holds is about FIXTURES and is **not evidence about PROVENANCE**; a fixture difficulty must not become a reason to re-key a security rule. It flagged its own bias again, correctly.
4. 🔴 **ONE MEASUREMENT OWED BEFORE OPTION 1 IS ACCEPTED — the possibility nobody had costed.** The policy's view of an address and the transport's destination are two layers, and the harness currently makes them one, so every address a test can bind is refused. **If they separate — stub the allowed NAME to an address the strict branch ALLOWS, intercept below the policy so the bytes reach a local listener — every open-window cell survives with its assertion unchanged.** ⚠ **Tuesday has NOT read the preload and said so; the layer S73 uses today CANNOT do it** (`undici:client:connected`/`connectError`/`beforeConnect` are diagnostics channels — they observe, they cannot redirect). Three candidate seams, none read: **undici custom `connect`/`setGlobalDispatcher` · `AOAI_FETCH_OPTIONS` (exists 3× at `60c76d7`, Tuesday's read) · `MockAgent` (may be too high a layer to count a real dial).** **A CONTROL proving no packet reaches the public address is mandatory — an interception that fails open dials a real host from a test suite, which is worse than the coverage loss.**
5. **If all three seams are no: option 1 is the ruling AND the deleted coverage becomes a TICKET.** K-live bounds the RATE of a C-59-permitted behaviour; **coverage does not evaporate because a fixture became impossible.**

### 🟢 AMENDED 23:0x — THE SEAM EXISTS. OPTION 1 IS NOT NEEDED. **BUT THE RESCUE IS CONDITIONAL AND THE CONDITION IS BINDING.**
S73 measured it (13:00:41Z, spf/dkim/dmarc pass): **none of the three candidates — a FOURTH. Patch `net.connect` IN THE PRELOAD, matching on the HOSTNAME**, because undici hands its connector the hostname and resolves internally, so `dns.promises.lookup` (what the policy calls) can answer a public address while the socket lands on a local listener. **POLICY: ALLOW on the strict branch, resolved `['192.0.2.1']` · fetch HTTP 200 from the local listener · socket opened to 192.0.2.1: NONE.**
- The three eliminated: **undici is not in `node_modules` at all** (direct or transitive); **`AOAI_FETCH_OPTIONS` is frozen PRODUCT code** (`azureOpenAIAdapter.js:101`), so using it would turn a fixture into a product edit; **`MockAgent` refused on its own merits — it satisfies the HTTP assertion without opening a socket, so it defeats the very cell whose subject is that a dial happened.**
- **Its control pair removed the hazard rather than just detecting it:** the negative arm (its own matcher bug, disclosed) threw **AbortError at 4 s with an empty listener**, so a silently-failing interception is LOUD not green; and the address is **192.0.2.1, TEST-NET-1 (RFC 5737), guaranteed unrouted.**

🔴 **THE CONDITION, ADOPTED VERBATIM FROM ITS OWN CAVEAT — DO NOT DROP IT: the seam was measured WITHOUT the fix's address pinning.** Design §3.6's pinned `guardedFetch` may hand the connector `192.0.2.1` instead of the hostname, at which point a hostname matcher **stops matching**. **TWO measurements, not one: today's code (DONE) and the wired-plus-pinned code (OWED — BUT SEE THE 23:1x CORRECTION).** 🔴 **CORRECTED 23:1x, and it is a correction to Tuesday's own ruling, not to S73: the second measurement CANNOT BE TAKEN YET.** It depends on §3.6's pinned `guardedFetch`, **which does not exist** — so asking for "two measurements" was loose. **It is NOT the RD-516 seat's to hold context open for; it belongs to whoever BUILDS the fix, and it rides as a named PRECONDITION on any open-window cell being declared rescued.** S73 told at its 50% checkpoint not to start it. **No open-window cell is "rescued" until the second exists — they are CANDIDATES until then, and if the caveat kills the seam, option 1 returns WITH the retired-coverage ticket.**
🔴 **RULED on S73's own catch: R3 must NOT be built on this mechanism** — the harness's interception is the same manoeuvre R3 exists to detect, so a cell built on it tests the harness against itself. **The REASON goes into R3's cell, not only into the mail**, or the next reader simplifies it onto the convenient seam and loses the discrimination silently (the R8-comment discipline).
⚠ **Tuesday ratified the SHAPE and the CONTROL DESIGN only. "No new dependency, no product change" is S73's read, recorded as its read — Tuesday has not opened the preload.**

### 🔴 THE DEPLOYMENT COUNT IS ANSWERED — IT IS KAM'S, AND THE REASON IS MEASURED. PASTE THIS INTO THE MORNING REPORT.
Kam ruled **(a) at 21:14**, applied to the card at 21:38: *"Tell me the deployment count and I decide from there."* **It gates BOTH this card and `nexusai-privacy-keyvault-claim-rd518` — one answer settles two.**
- **This seat holds NO Azure identity:** `azureProfile.json` is 61 B, `az account show` → *"Please run 'az login'"*.
- **The NexusAI seat IS authed and to the wrong place for this question:** tenant `d500ebad-cf53-4f2a-a501-f831289e67fc`, sub `0c57ab37…`, a service principal, scoped by design to NexusAI's own resource groups. **Customers deploy into THEIR OWN subscriptions — no identity we hold can enumerate them.** This is structural, not a permissions gap to fix.
- **Authoritative source: Partner Center analytics under his Datasec publishing account.** Offer **`printer-dashboard-managed-app`**, publisher **`datasecau`** — both read from the repo at HEAD. **The URL recorded in the repo is `https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/overview`. Do NOT compose a deeper analytics link — nobody here has opened one.**

### 🔴 AMENDED Mon 2026-09-21 00:0x — **the 28 ARE A MERGE BLOCKER. THIS CORRECTS THE SPLIT RULING ABOVE. READ IT BEFORE SEQUENCING ANYTHING.**
- 🟢 **SEAM USABLE = YES, measured at the wired policy. `315061a`: 27 passed / 2 failed / 1 skipped.** All four conditions hold on the STRICT branch. **SEAM-2 is the permanent control and its control is the ABSENCE of `SEAM_OFF` from the intercept map** (one policy verdict both arms; the cell says not to "tidy up" by adding it). **R7 RESCUED, left FAILING for RD-585 only** — containment green (`sinkRequests 0`, `redirectorWasReached true`), naming absent.
- 🔴 **THE CORRECTION: those 26 cells PASS ON MAIN TODAY AND BREAK THE MOMENT RD-516's POLICY MERGES.** So they are NOT follow-up work — **RD-516 CANNOT MERGE while they are unfixed**, or main is knowingly red (`no-skip-on-failure`).
- ✅ **RESOLUTION, no redesign needed — the inertness criterion already does it: the 28 go on their OWN branch, which merges BEFORE RD-516.** They are inert by construction (each fixture passes with and without the policy — that is what the before/after pairs prove), so they land on main independently and harmlessly.
- 🔴 **RD-516's MERGE CONDITION GAINS A CLAUSE: "the 28 are on main."** It belongs in the gate brief's acceptance section so the GATE reports on it and nobody merges past it.
- 🔴 **DO NOT rescue them inside RD-516's branch** (rebuilds the mixed diff the split avoids) **and DO NOT launch a parallel seat for them while S73 is live: they span rd464, rd486, rd523, rd545, ai-config and S73 holds rd523 + rd545.** Two of five — the partition forbids it. **They go to S73's SUCCESSOR with a brief Tuesday writes.**
- ✅ **RATIFIED, S73's cross-ticket find: the seam redirects TCP to a PLAIN-HTTP listener, so it serves `http://` and NOT `https://`.** **RD-583's scheme rule and the seam's TLS limitation are ONE dependency, priced together** (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` local TLS listener answers both). On both tickets.

🔴 **NUMBER CORRECTED 00:1x — IT IS 27, NOT 26, AND THE ERROR WAS TUESDAY'S STALENESS.** S73's 13:25 mail said *"Seam-dependent is 27, not 26"* when it reclassified rd523's **E3** (the wizard TYPES the endpoint, so `endpointSource: 'request'` and the STRICT branch applies). **Tuesday then quoted 26 in five places across the rulings and this pickup, after its author had already superseded it in the same thread.** Same root as tonight's "5 commits behind" row: a figure carried forward after its referent moved. **S73 used 27 throughout its brief and said why, in the brief. Its number is the record.**
- **Asked of S73 and owed in its handover: the NAMED list of the 28 with what each needs, at a durable path.** That is what makes the successor brief writable in minutes.

### 🟢 AMENDED 23:4x — CHANGE 2 IS BUILT AND ACCEPTED (`b2dea38`), AND RULING (3) UNBLOCKED the 28
- **`b2dea38` verified at origin** (`refs/heads/rd-516-ai-test-ssrf-s73`). **24 passed / 3 failed / 1 skipped**, every failure accounted for. **RD-584** (rebinding window, carrying Tuesday's corrected step) and **RD-585** (R7's unnamed refusal) filed.
- **Ruling (b) validated: `resolveAiTestCredentials` returns `{endpoint, apiKey, keySource}` UNCHANGED; `resolveAiTestEndpointSource` answers provenance; both projections of ONE internal branch decision. rd486's four unit cells pass UNTOUCHED.**
- 🟢 **THE TAXONOMY FIX, read at source by Tuesday: §3.4's ADDRESS reasons were UNREACHABLE** because a literal IP is never a sourced host, so `169.254.169.254` audited as `HOST_NOT_ON_SOURCED_LIST` — true, useless, would have shipped. Fixed at `:200-209` (`net.isIP` branch), finding written as a comment at `:190-199`. **Caught only because two cells asserted the REASON, not the status.** Also `:169-171`: a literal resolves to itself explicitly, which stops a resolver stub relocating a literal.
- ✅ **R8 RATIFIED AS A SCOPE REFUSAL — do not "fix" it here.** Two limiters are still mounted because RD-541's collapse belongs to RD-464 r3 via C-70 and did not happen. **C-106: the collapse is NOT symmetric and the wrong one silently reopens RD-545.** R7/R7-control join the 28. R10i skipped, RD-583.
- 🔴 **THE UNBLOCK — and it is Tuesday's own ruling undoing Tuesday's own objection, having been wrong in BOTH directions in one evening (first asking for an impossible measurement, then saying it was not that seat's to hold): under (3) THERE IS NO PINNING, so the adapter keeps global `fetch`, undici resolves internally and hands its connector the HOSTNAME — exactly the condition the 13:00 seam measurement used. THE CAVEAT IS MOOT; THE SECOND MEASUREMENT IS AVAILABLE NOW against the wired policy at `b2dea38`.** the 28 may be rescuable and RD-574's remainder becomes a fixture job. **Number owed, not acted on.**
- 🔴 **NEW OBLIGATION: if 27 cells rest on the `net.connect` patch, the patch is LOAD-BEARING TEST INFRASTRUCTURE.** A Node/undici change stops it matching and **cells asserting a refusal go GREEN because nothing was dialled.** **Its negative control becomes a PERMANENT CELL** — one cell asserting that with the patch inactive the request fails at the transport — or 27 cells sit on an undetectable single point of failure.
- **NEXT for that seat:** R6 against the real implementation · the DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE §3.2.1 line · the full-suite number · **R3 stays UNWRITTEN until RD-584** (a cell that passes for want of a mechanism is worse than none). **Ends at READY FOR QA and it is a TIER-1 gate — an SSRF surface.**

### 🔴 AMENDED 23:3x — THE §3.6 ADDRESS PINNING IS NOT IMPLEMENTABLE, AND IT IS RULED. **DO NOT RE-OPEN OPTION (2).**
S73 measured: `require('undici')` → MODULE_NOT_FOUND (not a dep, direct or transitive), `node:undici` → ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE. So §3.6's *"an undici Agent whose `connect.lookup` returns only an approved address"* cannot be built as designed. Three ways out:
1. 🔴 **OPTION (2) — reaching `Agent` via `Symbol.for('undici.globalDispatcher.1')` + a prototype walk — IS REFUSED PERMANENTLY.** S73 refused to build it; Tuesday ratified in the strongest terms. **Undocumented internals whose failure mode is that pinning silently stops while everything stays green** — the exact class this round found all night, built deliberately. **If anyone proposes it again, this is the answer.**
2. 🟢 **OPTION (3) IS THE RULING: layers 0-2 SHIP** (type + sourced single-label host allow-list + resolved ADDRESS class on every record) **and the rebinding window is TICKETED, with S73's reasoning ON the ticket.** The design's *"decorative"* line is read as **overtaken by layer 1** and that reading goes on the ticket; **§3.6 is NOT edited** (same discipline as §3.3).
3. ⚠ **OPTION (1) IS NOT A DEPENDENCY LINE AND MUST NOT BE PRICED FROM ITS APPEARANCE.** The decider, unmeasured: **does Node's BUILT-IN `fetch` accept a `dispatcher` that is an `Agent` from a separately-installed `undici`?** **If NO, (1) means moving the adapter from global `fetch` to `undici.fetch` — which re-hosts RD-523's `redirect: 'error'` guard on a different implementation**, on the one path in this family whose failure cost is a customer's api-key on someone else's host. Plus the two-undici-instances problem. **Take that measurement before anyone calls (1) cheap.**
🔴 **CARDED FOR KAM: `nexusai-rd516-undici-dependency-for-address-pinning`, DEFAULT = (c), the safe option already in force.** Nothing waits on it. The gate refused it on a substring match for "address"; all five priors were read and dismissed individually inside `_override_prior`, so the override is checkable.

### 🔴 THE CORRECTION TO S73's REASONING — conclusion right, one step wrong, and it is the step a later reader would build on
It argued the rebind is unreachable because *"they do not own those names."* **Measured in its own module: line 110's hint is `https://YOUR-RESOURCE.openai.azure.com`, and the suffix table is four sourced suffixes with a single-label rule at line 124. So an attacker with an Azure subscription CAN own a name under the allow-list — their own Azure OpenAI resource is exactly that.**
**What protects us is narrower: they cannot control the ADDRESS behind an allowed name, because those A records are Microsoft-managed.** A rebind needs control of the RESOLUTION, not of the NAME.
🔑 **Why the distinction is load-bearing: "only Microsoft owns those names" invites a later reader to trust the HOST and relax something on that basis. An allowed host CAN be attacker-owned. Trust the address class, never the name.**
⚠ **OPEN, asked of S73 and not asserted: is key EXFILTRATION to an attacker's OWN Azure OpenAI resource already ticketed?** The allow-list does not stop it by construction. Possibly RD-549's, possibly already filed.
**R7, flagged by S73 and RULED to be filed TONIGHT rather than "later":** `code: undefined` with `sinkRequests: 0` and `redirectorWasReached: true` = **RD-523's protection works and its error is not NAMED on the caller-named ai-test path.** Read later, it looks like RD-516 broke RD-523; a ticket with those three field values is what prevents the misreading.
**Red proof REPLACED with S73's version (mine was vacuous under (3)):** assert at source that the adapter still passes `AOAI_FETCH_OPTIONS` and that RD-516 added no `fetch:` option, with the mutation *delete the `fetchOptions` argument at `:157` → RD-523's cells must redden* — **plus Tuesday's addition: assert the ABSENCE of any `dispatcher`/`fetch`/custom-agent introduced on that path, with a control**, because vacuity is the risk.

### 🔴 TWO CORRECTIONS THIS SEAT OWES, ONE OF THEM ABOUT DELTA 43 ITSELF
1. **DELTA 43's tap-rule detector is WRONG IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Do not use it.** `tail -6 | grep -cE '✻|✳|✽|✢'` returned **0 on this seat's OWN mid-turn pane** (false negative) and later **1 on a STOPPED pane** (false positive — it matches `✻ Cogitated for 6m 47s · done 10:48 pm`, because the completed-turn marker uses the same glyph as the live one). **Found only by running the control on a pane whose state was already known.** **Replace it with: the last content line plus the prompt — `done HH:MM` above a bare `❯` is STOPPED — and then the question that actually decides a tap, WHETHER A WAKE EXISTS (`ps -eo pid,etime,command | grep <the job>` for a live background job, which re-invokes on exit).**
2. **Tuesday wrote into NexusAI's `4_Credentials/` — disclosed.** `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=<NexusAI>/… az account show` stamped `az.sess` and `commands/` at **22:53:59**; `azureProfile.json` untouched, so no credential state moved. **Not reverted (reverting a session marker is a second write).** **THE RULE, proven the same session: read `azureProfile.json` with `encoding='utf-8-sig'` — it yields the identical tenant/sub/user and leaves the mtime alone. `az`/`gh`/`docker`/`kubectl`/`terraform` write to their config dir on EVERY invocation including queries: there is no read-only subcommand, only a read-only PATH.**

### STILL OPEN AND NOT STARTED — unchanged from DELTA 43 except where named
- 🔴 **THE MORNING REPORT IS STILL OWED — AND IT IS NOW DRAFTED AT A PATH, not left as material.** **`5_Project_History/2026-09-21_morning-report-draft.md`** holds panel-ready words plus a RE-VERIFY list (floor, gauge, `kam_rulings_today.sh`, the inbox, and "delete any line you cannot re-verify"). **A rotation now costs a re-read, not a rebuild.** It carries real content: the answered provenance question, the RD-574 ruling, **and the deployment-count answer above, which is the one thing he asked for.**
- **`where-should-project-decision-records-live` — ruled (a) 19:39, still not actioned.** Note for whoever takes it: **the move itself is the PROJECT agent's action, never this seat's** (`1_Project_Definition/` is a sibling of the repo; hard rule 1). This seat's job is the commission, with the gitleaks constraints from DELTA 42 item 5 attached — `gitleaks git .`, fingerprint suppression in COMMIT form, canary drawn from the ruleset.
- **RD-578** (azure-ad name fix changes AUTH behaviour) — provisioning question stands. **RD-580/581/582 To Do**, read back off the board by S73.
- 🟢 **THE SPOTLIGHT CHECK IS ANSWERED — no need to "look tomorrow". THE FOLDER EXCLUSION IS NOT IN PLACE.** Direct probe: `mdfind -onlyin '/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/!CODING' -count 'kMDItemFSName == "*.js"'` → **1,802,024**, control (`$HOME` `*.plist` → 44) fires. Census over four mechanisms: volume `VolumeConfiguration.plist` `Exclusions=[]` · no exclusion keys in either user-level Spotlight plist · no `.metadata_never_index`/`.noindex` marker in `!CODING` or at the volume root · the probe above. **Index 13.01 GiB, up from 12.3 GiB this morning — growing. T9 free 647 GiB.** ⚠ **Frame stated: those four places only; macOS 27 may store an exclusion elsewhere, so the claim is "absent from all four I measured and the folder is indexed", NOT "he did not do it".** 🔑 **Why it is not a contradiction of Kam: THAT CARD HAD TWO HALVES** — the 649 GiB Unison temp (which he deleted himself ~15:2x, DELTA 32) and the exclusion. **"actioned. remove card" most plausibly meant the temp file.** **Lesson, and it is Tuesday's: a two-subject card gets a one-word ruling and one subject silently survives it.** **FOR THE MORNING REPORT, not a separate message — disk is fine, nothing is blocked.**
- **The package email** to `kreiser.org@me.com` — zip only, sha256 + head, on the trigger of BOTH RD-516 and RD-518 landing, version field **2.2.0**. Not ready; do not send a partial.

---

## 🔴 DELTA 43 — 2026-09-20 22:4x ROTATION HANDOVER (Tuesday ctx 80%, safe boundary). **READ THIS, THEN 42, THEN 41 (the overnight contract + the MORNING REPORT you owe Kam).**

### THE ONE RULING THAT MUST NOT BE RE-OPENED BY A FRESH SEAT
🔴 **S73 proposed re-keying RD-516's RFC1918/loopback relaxation on PROVENANCE OF THE WRITE (deployment ENV vs settings store) instead of Q2b's TRUSTED-STORED. IT IS HELD, NOT ADOPTED.** Its argument is good and its axis may be right — **but its premise is measurably FALSE, and a fresh seat reading only its mail will find the argument persuasive.**

**MEASURED BY TUESDAY at `60c76d7`, `backend/server.js:4433` AND `:4684` (identical):**
```
const endpoint = await jsonStorage.getSetting('azureOpenAIEndpoint');   // FROM THE STORE
const aiLoaderStatus = await aiProvenance.readStatus(jsonStorage);
if (!(aiLoaderStatus.state === 'confirmed' && aiLoaderStatus.mode === 'admin')) { ...warn... }
else { if (endpoint && !process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT) process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = endpoint; ... }
```
**The settings store IS copied into `process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` at boot.** So env is **deploy-time OR store-promoted**, not the untouchable fact the proposed rule would trust.

🔴 **Why that is the dangerous direction: C-92 lets anyone confirm pending AI config while sign-in is unconfigured, and S73 proved that chain tonight (plant → `aoaiPending.fingerprint` → confirm → test, dialsToPlanted 3). IF an anonymous confirm can reach `mode: 'admin'`, the planted endpoint is promoted into env at the next boot and the proposed rule ALLOWS it — the SSRF reopens one restart later AND LOOKS CLOSED.**

**COMMISSIONED, answer owed in S73's READY either way: can an anonymous caller in the open window produce `state: confirmed, mode: admin`?** With a control. **If yes, it is a ticket ABOVE RD-516 in severity.**

**And the point that stands whichever way it lands:** `process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` cannot distinguish deploy-time from promoted **because the promotion writes the same key**, so `endpointSource === 'env'` would be *true and misleading*. A provenance rule needs provenance that survives the promotion — a third value, or the loader stamping origin as it writes.

⚠ **Honest limit, stated to S73 and repeated here: Tuesday measured `server.js` ONLY. The tree-wide grep returned nothing for the pattern AND for its positive control, so it was BROKEN and the tree-wide claim is UNMEASURED.** There may be other promotion sites.

### FLOOR AT ROTATION
- **`%20` `Datasec/NexusAI` (S73) — the only live seat, untouched by this rotation.** RD-516, branch `8aaafd9`, 26 cells / 11 green / 15 red, **no product code yet**. Doing the CHANGE-1 fixture work (inertness criterion) and the anonymous-confirm measurement. **ctx was ~38% at last read — re-read it, do not inherit that number.**
- **`main` = `60c76d7`. Minimum set: RD-516 · RD-518.** RD-518's fix round staged at `fleet/briefs_staged/nexusai_rd518_fix_round2.md`, **round 2 of 2, a third is Kam's**, queued behind RD-516 (both touch `server.js`).
- Usage **92%**; Kam lifted the 95% stop **for tonight only**, no stated date — **re-ask before Monday.**

### THE TAP RULE THIS SEAT LEARNED THE HARD WAY — USE IT
**Read the pane state IN THE SAME ACTION as the send/no-send decision.** A running seat reads its inbox at its own checkpoint and needs no tap; a seat at a bare prompt reads nothing until tapped. **I left S73 idle TWICE by getting this wrong, the second time from a six-minute-old reading.** The check: `tmux capture-pane -p -t %20 | tail -6 | grep -cE '✻|✳|✽|✢'` — zero means STOPPED, tap required.

---

## 🌙 DELTA 42 — 2026-09-20 22:3x. **STATE SINCE 41. The overnight contract in DELTA 41 STILL GOVERNS — read it too, especially the morning report.**

### THE FLOOR
- **`%20` `Datasec/NexusAI` (S73) — the ONLY live seat.** RD-516, ctx ~38%. Branch **`8aaafd9`** pushed; 26 cells, 11 green, 15 red. **No product code written yet** — the fix comes after the cells are honest.
- **`main` = `60c76d7`.** Minimum set is **TWO: RD-516 · RD-518.**
- **RD-518 was GATED NO GO** (Blocker). Fix round **STAGED, NOT LAUNCHED**: `fleet/briefs_staged/nexusai_rd518_fix_round2.md`. 🔴 **Round 2 of 2 — a third is Kam's (C-62).** Held behind RD-516: both touch `backend/server.js`.
- Usage **92%**. Kam lifted the 95% stop **for tonight only** — no stated date, **re-ask before Monday**.

### RULINGS THIS SEAT MADE THAT THE NEXT ONE MUST NOT RE-OPEN
1. **RD-574's scope: SPLIT BY INERTNESS.** The collision is structural across ~5 suites, not just rd523. **Fixture change FIRST as its own change, acceptance criterion INERTNESS** (run each affected suite before and after at current main; identical results, or the fixture changed behaviour and that is a finding). **Policy second, on top.** Green at both points — no red main, no mixed diff. **If the measured break set is small, S73 may fold it in and say so; that judgement is its own.** For every borrowed cell: **the assertion is unchanged, only the endpoint moves.**
2. **R8 goes SOURCE-LEVEL with a mutation** — headers are byte-identical between one mount and two (measured), so nothing at response level can discriminate. **The REASON must be written in the cell** or the next reader "improves" it back into an unfalsifiable form.
3. **R3 and R6 move to after the fix** (S73's call, ratified): neither can be red-proved against code that does not exist.
4. **C-106 filed** — the C-70 collapse is not symmetric; the limiter that must survive is the one with **no `skip`**. Tuesday verified it at source with a positive control.
5. **The CLARIFICATIONS move is AUTHORISED but NOT DUE.** Kam ruled (a) 19:39. **The card's own words: "deliberately, not by a seat mid-task."** 🔴 **And it carries a hazard — C-103 quotes credential-shaped canaries and CI has never scanned that file, so the move needs `gitleaks git .` (CI's mode, NOT `gitleaks dir`), suppression by fingerprint in COMMIT form, canary drawn from the ruleset.** Marked `--delivered`; queued as its own piece of work.

### THE PATTERN THIS SEAT KEEPS MEETING, AND S73 FOUND EVERY INSTANCE
**A green that means NOT OBSERVED rather than DID NOT HAPPEN** — five tonight: the `dialsTo()` matcher comparing an authority to a bare host so every zero was matcher-satisfied · the counter watching `connected`/`connectError` so a black-holed dial reads 0 while in flight · a dial appearing under two keys · undici pooling by origin · R2 green on the word *"image"*. Plus its sharper sequels: **`?.()` turns a missing method into a silent success path**, and **a wrong-reason RED becomes a wrong-reason GREEN the moment the product starts refusing things** (CTRL-5 exists for exactly that).

### 🔴 THIS SEAT'S OWN FAILURE MODE TONIGHT, STATED SO THE NEXT ONE DOES BETTER
**Four staleness failures on four different subjects, all the same sentence: a measurement was true when taken and false when asserted.** The 12-second reproach to S71 · "5 commits behind current main" measured against a referent I then moved by authorising the merge · a NOT-TESTED list from one run asserted to Kam as coverage over all runs · a six-minute-old pane state asserted as "mid-turn", which left S73 idle twice.
**The countermeasure is ORDERING, not knowledge: decide first, measure last, send in the same breath.** It worked once it was applied — the last send read the pane in the same action and the tool queued the tap behind a turn that had just started.

---

## 🌙 DELTA 41 — 2026-09-20 21:4x. **KAM HAS TURNED IN. THIS IS THE OVERNIGHT CONTRACT. READ THIS FIRST.**

### HIS WORDS, VERBATIM (panel, ~21:43)
> *"Thanks, perfect. I'm going to turn in for now. Please keep going through the night and let me know how you go."*
And earlier, which governs how the work is done: *"No problem if it's not ready in the morning. **I would much rather it done properly than quickly.**"*
And on spend: *"Don't hold depending on the count, just keep going. If the credits run out, I'll sign in to a new account in the morning."*

### 🔴 THE ONE THING THIS SEAT OWES THAT A ROTATION COULD LOSE — THE MORNING REPORT
**"Let me know how you go" is a PROMISE until a mechanism produces it. This section is the mechanism**, because the boot prompt makes the pickup's OWED items the first work of any session.
**WHOEVER IS AWAKE WHEN KAM SURFACES WRITES A REPORT TO HIS PANEL** (`tools/chat_reply.sh`), not a mail. He was told it would be on the panel. Shape, in this order:
1. **What LANDED** — merges, verdicts, tickets closed, with the head SHAs. Leads with product, not mechanics.
2. **What NEEDS HIM** — the deployment count for `nexusai-degraded-flip-and-live-deployments`; anything that hit a signature class; the usage/account state if the allowance ran out.
3. **What was LEFT ALONE and why** — explicitly, so silence is never read as completion.
4. **The honest state of the package**: it does not go until RD-516 and RD-518 both land, and it is built fresh from the new main with the version field set to **2.2.0**.
**If the night produced little, say that plainly.** He priced it himself: properly beats quickly, and a thin honest report is worth more than a padded one.

### THE FLOOR AT HANDOVER (21:44)
- **`%19` `QA/NexusAI-RD518`** — tier-1 gate on `6ea15a0`, ~22 min in, working. Its two must-measures are **M-A** (drive `/api/admin/health` ANONYMOUSLY in the open window, **paired with a control** so a 403 proves the instrument can see a refusal) and **M-B** (force `jsonStorage` falsy). Verdict comes to `tuesday-agent@`, subject `[QA/Datasec-NexusAI -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — RD-518 @ 6ea15a0 (tier 1)`.
- **`%20` `Datasec/NexusAI` (S73)** — RD-516, the `ai-test` SSRF. Plan confirmed; ctx 23% at handover. Its four questions are answered in the 11:35Z ANSWER mail: **Q1 my error (C-28 forbids pulling that tree — its fetch+worktree approach is ratified), Q2 RD-574 rides inside its branch on candidate (a) with the fixture changing and NEVER the policy, Q3 take only the cells and reference the design by `89fbea5:<path>`, Q4 re-ruled because I could not find the ruling it cited.**
- **`main` = `60c76d7`.** RD-464 r3 merged tonight. **Minimum set is TWO: RD-516 · RD-518.**
- **Usage 92% at handover, climbing.** Kam lifted the 95% stop **for tonight only** — see EXPIRING-GRANTS; it has no stated date and is **re-asked before Monday**, not assumed.

### WHAT TO DO WITH EACH OUTCOME, so no seat has to invent a policy at 3am
- **Gate returns GO / GO WITH FINDINGS** → verify the head at origin in the same action, **GO the merge** (v1.3, reversible, inside commissioned work), have the *project* seat merge it — never this seat's hands — then file any Major as its own ticket.
- **Gate returns NO GO** → that is round 1 of 2 on this class. Commission the fix round on the same branch; **a third round is Kam's (C-62)**, so if round 2 also fails, STOP and card it.
- **S73 reaches READY FOR QA** → it needs its own tier-1 gate. Launch it (the RD-518 launcher is the pattern; **check the gauge in the same action as the decision — do not inherit 92%**).
- **Either seat goes idle** → it is NOT holding by design unless its mail says so. Read the pane, then its inbox. **A pane is not a channel** and the watcher is the backstop, not the plan.
- **Anything signature-class** → production, money, external comms, irreversible: **it waits for Kam**, whatever the hour. The spend grant lifted a ceiling, not a boundary.

### STILL OPEN AND NOT STARTED
- **`where-should-project-decision-records-live` — Kam ruled (a) at 19:39: *"Move it into the repo and update the boot contract."*** Recovered from the reconciler bug tonight and **not yet actioned.** It is real work and it is this seat's.
- **The `[Wednesday -> …]` subject prefix** on mail from this seat. **Deliberately not fixed** — `send_brief.sh:608-618` explains it is the fleet's routing key and flipping it blinds this seat's own agents until their boot prompts accept the tag. **The sequencing is ours to drive:** agents accept `[Tuesday -> …]` first, prefix flips second.
- **RD-578** (azure-ad name fix changes AUTH behaviour) — filed, its provisioning question stands, explicitly not tonight's.
- **The deployment count** — Kam ruled (a) "tell me the count". Likely Partner Center under his login, **unconfirmed**; establish reachability and hand him either the number or a straight "this one is yours".

---

## 🟢 DELTA 40 — 2026-09-20 20:3x (s73; ctx 54% CHECKPOINT, band 80-90, NOT rotating). **r3 IS ON MAIN. THE FLOOR IS CLEAR. SUPERSEDES DELTA 39 on state.**

### WHERE EVERYTHING IS
- 🟢 **`main` = `60c76d7` — RD-464 r3 IS MERGED.** Verified by Tuesday at origin: `60c76d7`, `1f27b4d` and `34ad321` all contained. **RD-464 → Release Ready.**
- 🟢 **RD-518 built and pushed: `rd-518-kv-identity-s72` @ `6ea15a0`.** PASS 3709/210, prediction exact **read from the file**, 7/7 cells red-proved, **M5 reddens R5 alone**. **AWAITING ITS TIER-1 GATE.**
- **Filed tonight: RD-578** (azure-ad name fix changes AUTH behaviour — S72 reverted it out of its own work) · **RD-579** (F-1, High). **RD-577 corrected** (comment 37878 + description panel, original wording kept as the evidence).
- **BOTH PANES CLOSED**, listeners 11 → 11 each. **Gate scored 1.00, S72 scored 0.97.** Nothing is live but this seat and fleet-monitor.
- **MINIMUM SET IS NOW TWO: RD-516 · RD-518.** (r3 is done.) **The package zip still does not go until both land.**

### 🔴 THE RD-518 GATE'S TWO MUST-MEASURES — put these in its brief BY NAME
S72 asked whether to fix the `detail` residual before the gate. **RULED: no — measure first, then fix against what was measured.**
- **M-A.** Drive `/api/admin/health` **ANONYMOUSLY** on a local run at `6ea15a0` in the **open first-run window** and report verbatim whether `keyVaultEncryption.detail` is present. **Pair it with a control** — the same request where the gate should refuse — so a 403 proves the instrument can see a refusal at all.
- **M-B.** Force `jsonStorage` falsy and request the same route: it wraps its gate in `if (jsonStorage)`, so a falsy store skips the gate entirely.
- **If M-A is clean, the deliverable is ONE honest line:** change the comment from *"NOT public"* to **admin-gated and unredacted**. **A comment asserting a property the code does not enforce is the defect being corrected, not the exposure.**
- Why not fix blind: `detail` interpolates `how` (the identity clientId) and `e.message` (the SDK error, which routinely carries the vault URL). Whether that matters depends on reachability, which is a measurement. Fixing first spends a round on an unsized remedy — the shape that produced the `managedIdentityClientId` no-op.

### 🔴 THE VAULT — ALREADY RULED, DO NOT RE-CARD IT
**`tuesday-mini-vault-three-unpushed-commits` was ruled (a) by Kam at 16:44 TODAY: *"Leave it; nothing pushes from the mini."*** `decision_queue.sh add` refused a new card on the prior ruling and **`amend` refused too** — *"a ruling records what Kam decided against what he was SHOWN, so amending it rewrites his reasoning."* **Both refusals were correct and `--override-prior-rulings` was the wrong answer.** Measured tonight and recorded here instead:
- **516 behind / 5 ahead**, four stranded Datasec daily sections (S46 09-07, S48 09-16, S67 09-19, S72 09-20), each **disjoint** from upstream's copy — zero token hits upstream, positive control fires.
- **Five of the seven dirty files are BYTE-IDENTICAL to upstream**; they read as modified only because local HEAD is ancient. The "other sessions' uncommitted work" premise is largely a stale-HEAD artefact.
- 🔴 **THE HAZARD NOBODY HAD NAMED: `daily/2026-09-19.md` is a 2,545 B stub locally vs 39,449 B upstream — 319 lines exist ONLY upstream. Letting the LOCAL side win destroys other seats' work.** The old card named only the push hazard. **Kam's ruling already prevents this, which is exactly why it needs no new card.**
- Trend, from the stranded commits' own messages: **484 (09-16) → 509 (09-19) → 516 (09-20)**. Three sessions recorded it in local commit messages nobody reads.

### WHAT THE NEXT SEAT DOES, IN ORDER
1. **RD-516** — cells rescued on `rd-516-cells-s70-recovered` @ `89fbea5`, **authored, NOT RUN, un-gated**; `testPathIgnorePatterns` is why they are inert. Moving them into the suite is a deliberate step.
2. **The RD-518 tier-1 gate** at `6ea15a0` carrying M-A and M-B. ⚠ **Weekly usage was 90% at this seat's checkpoint against a 95% stop — read the gauge in the same action as the launch decision, do not inherit this number.**
3. **RD-578** — its own first question stands: are `azure-ad-client-id` and `azure-ad-client-secret` provisioned into the vault by the template at all?

### 🔴 A LAUNCHER FIX OWED — MY GATE BRIEF POINTED AT A DIRECTORY THAT DOES NOT EXIST
The QA prompt said to read the AgentMail key from *"this project's `4_Credentials/.env`"*. **`Testing Agent MAIN` has no `4_Credentials` at all** (measured; NexusAI's does exist, which is the control). The gate found the key in `TUESDAY/4_Credentials/.env` and **reported it as O-3 rather than routing around it silently**. **My launcher's identity guard PASSED while the prompt was wrong, because it asserted NexusAI's credentials root — a neighbouring fact, not the claim.** **Next QA brief names the ABSOLUTE key path, never "this project's".**

### THREE THINGS FROM TONIGHT WORTH CARRYING
- **"A 204 says the server accepted a request; it does not say what it kept."** (S72) — read back at the destination, assert the properties, never trust the status code.
- **A census names a POPULATION, and the NAME is a claim that nothing in the count checks.** (S72, from RD-577's three reads being three different KINDS.) Folded into C-104 on Tuesday's ruling, not filed separately — Kam's (b) ruling says shrink the corpus.
- **In a guard CHAIN, a red arm proves guard N only if every guard before N provably PASSES on that arm's input.** Two of my four red arms tonight fired an upstream guard and looked like successes.

---

## 🟢 DELTA 39 — 2026-09-20 19:5x (s73 boot; ctx 29% after the WHOLE brain load). **THE GATE IS LAUNCHED AND S72 IS BUILDING. SUPERSEDES the "not launched" block below and the grant-expiry block.**

### WHAT IS RUNNING RIGHT NOW
- **`%18` `QA/NexusAI-RD464r3` — the TIER-1 gate on `60c76d7`, round 1 of 2. LAUNCHED 19:53.** Verified at **rung 5**, not on "launched": the pane was reading `backend/llm/index.js` inside `worktrees/s72-rd464-r3`. Verdict comes to `tuesday-agent@` with subject `[QA/Datasec-NexusAI -> Tuesday] GATE VERDICT — RD-464 r3 @ 60c76d7 (tier 1)`. Report at `Testing Agent MAIN/projects/nexusai/reports/2026-09-20-rd464-r3-60c76d7-tier1/report.md`.
- **`%17` `Datasec/NexusAI` (S72) — BUILDING RD-518.** GO mailed 09:50:23Z, verified at `datasec-nexusai@`, then tapped. It was **idle waiting on that word** for ~10 minutes; its own pane said so.
- **r3 STILL DOES NOT MERGE** on anyone's word until that verdict lands.

### 🔴 TWO CLAIMS IN THE BLOCK BELOW WERE WRONG — DO NOT RE-DERIVE THEM
1. **"Every existing QA launcher points at an unmounted DevMASTER."** A census over the wrong frame: true of the NEWEST launcher (Wednesday's Secuura one), **false of the NexusAI ones**. `launch_qa_nexusai_rd327_67c2992.sh` already carries `QA_DIR='/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/!CODING/Testing Agent MAIN'` and `TUE='/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/TUESDAY'`. **Check the frame before calling a class broken.**
2. **"`gen_launcher_from_template.py <template> <output>`" is not a general tool.** It is hardcoded to one past Secuura substitution (966 → 932) with asserted anchor counts; it would have REFUSED. The pickup named a mechanism by a shape it does not have.

### THE LAUNCHER, AND THE TWO GUARDS THAT ARE DIFFERENT
`fleet/qa-agent/launchers/launch_qa_nexusai_rd464_r3_60c76d7.sh`, derived from the RD-327 one.
- **The target is a MERGE COMMIT**, so the single-parent `rev-list --count BASE..HEAD == 1` guard is **replaced** by an assertion of the exact two parents from `rev-list --parents` (**exit 8**), and the ancestry guard runs for **both** parents (exit 7). A commit-count guard on a merge asks a question with no meaningful answer.
- **NEW exit 18:** the head must be at `refs/heads/<branch>` on ORIGIN. A gate cannot run against a sha that lives on one disk.

### 🔴 THE RED-PROOF LESSON WORTH CARRYING: TWO ARMS FIRED THE WRONG GUARD
A nonexistent parent trips **ancestry (7)** before the merge-shape guard (8), and a brief copied to a scratchpad trips **the brief-path guard (14)** before the subject guard (15). **Both arms "went red" and neither proved what it was cut to prove.** Re-cut against a **real ancestor that is not a parent** → 8 ✓ and by mutating `SUBJECT` in the script rather than moving the brief → 15 ✓. Plus: wrong branch → 18 ✓, head override → 6 ✓, **and the pass arm re-run AFTER the red arms → rc 0** ✓.
> **A red arm proves a guard only if you read WHICH guard refused. An exit code you expected and did not check is a control that agreed with you for the wrong reason.**

### DONE THIS SEAT
- **Both expiring grants moved below `## Expired`** (AWAY-2-DAYS, Ornith-q4-only). Weekday/date cross-derived; rows conserved (lines 39, 40 vs the heading at 25; the live TESTED row untouched at 9). **The AWAY grant's PREMISE had already ended ahead of its date** — he came back early. Neither renewed by inference.
- **The gate brief now carries the runbook's DURABLE path** — `docs/runbooks/local-run-for-qa.md` @ `853e5498765936fa537383ab90a3c87ac4c0ff4b` on `docs-local-run-runbook-s72`, verified in the object store — replacing "ask the builder", whose first copy was in `session-tools/`, outside version control.
- Panel receipt to Kam sent (no action asked of him).

### ⚠ THIS SEAT'S WEEK-INSTRUCTION FILE IS LAPSED AND WAS NOT ACTED ON
`tasks/WEEK-INSTRUCTION-TUESDAY.md` is `status: none`, `valid_until: 2026-09-16`. **Per the boot rule, a lapsed file is not authority.** The shared `WEEK-INSTRUCTION.md` is live-to-tonight but its `given:` is a `view=wednesday` line and its scope is Secuura/kintsugi. **Kam is expected to give a new week instruction Monday 2026-09-21 before he leaves that night** — that is the seat's copy to fill.

### STILL OPEN
- **Minimum set is still THREE: RD-516 · RD-518 · RD-464 r3.** The package zip is NOT ready and a partial one does not go.
- **Four cards on Kam's desk**, incl. `nexusai-degraded-flip-and-live-deployments` — unruled, and it gates the DEGRADED flip.
- **Owed to Kam on a trigger:** the package email to `kreiser.org@me.com`, zip only, sha256 + head, carrying the r3 hold, RD-549's already-written wording (DELTA 33), C-92/C-93, the Partner Center 2.2.0 version field and RD-536 row 14's two asks.
- **The Spotlight exclusion:** his card was withdrawn as "actioned", but Tuesday's instrument was the wrong one (`mdutil -s` is volume-level; the ask was a FOLDER exclusion). **The real evidence is whether the index STOPS GROWING — look tomorrow and tell him either way.** Index 13G, T9 free 649 GiB.

---

## 🟢 THE TIER-1 GATE BRIEF IS ALREADY WRITTEN — 2026-09-20 19:4x. **DO NOT REWRITE IT.**

**PATH: `2_Project_Files/fleet/qa-agent/briefs/2026-09-20_nexusai-rd464-r3-tier1.md`** — 92 lines, committed and pushed in THIS repo (tracked, not a scratchpad). **Tuesday wrote it; only the LAUNCH remains.**

**It already carries everything that cost this seat a session to assemble:** the target `60c76d7` with both parents verified as ancestors · **why the demo CANNOT test this** (RD-76: `/login` has ZERO `<form>` and ZERO `<input>`, so no test account opens it — and the instruction to say so in the verdict so nobody records a demo pass that did not happen) · **the gate's actual subject is the SEAM**, not either parent's work, because `getUsableLLMAdapter()` exists only on main and `aiReadiness` only on r3 · the two places carrying it with S72's measurements · **what is ALREADY measured so the gate does not redo it** (7/7 cells, M4 still reddens, counts 3772/214 read from the file, all eight symbol counts) · three known-fragile traps including the `module.exports` union and the C-104 multiple-of-3 tell.

🔴 **WHY IT IS NOT LAUNCHED, and it is a mechanism problem not a decision:** **every existing QA launcher points at `/Volumes/DevMASTER/!CODING/Testing Agent MAIN`, and DevMASTER is NOT MOUNTED.** The T9 copy EXISTS at `/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/!CODING/Testing Agent MAIN`. **A T9-pathed launcher must be generated first** — `fleet/qa-agent/gen_launcher_from_template.py <template> <output>`, then `--check` before any real launch. The newest existing launcher (`qa-agent/launchers/launch_qa_secuura_batch1097_1099.sh`) is Wednesday's Secuura one with eleven guard exits — **read it for the shape, do not run it.**

**Tuesday split here deliberately: the brief is the THINKING (material only that seat held), the launcher is MECHANICS (fifteen minutes and a path substitution).** Rotating mid-launch would have left exactly the half-done state this seat spent the day telling agents is worse than unstarted.

**Usage at the split: 89% against this seat's 95% stop (Kam, "bump yours to 95%"). A launch is permitted.**

---

## 🔴 KAM RULED TWO THINGS AT 19:40-19:41 — 2026-09-20. **READ BEFORE ANY CARD OR BRIEF.**

Both delivered **by the panel directly to `tuesday-agent@`**, NOT relayed — and **the local `chat_kam.json` was 66 MINUTES STALE at the time**, so `kam_rulings_today.sh` showed neither. The prescribed fetch+rebase did NOT help (the other seat had not pushed). **The mail had them; the panel log did not. When the tool warns it is stale, CHECK THE MAIL — an empty tail is not silence.**

**1. 19:40:01 — `nexusai-privacy-keyvault-claim-rd518`: (a), VERBATIM:**
> *"Decision nexusai-privacy-keyvault-claim-rd518: a — Fix RD-518 before submission; change no documents (Recommended)"*
**PRIVACY.md and TERMS are NOT edited — the claim becomes true by the FIX, not by softening the words.** He took the harder of the two answers: option (b) would have made the document accurate immediately by weakening a claim; he chose to keep the claim and make it true. **The sentence that must end up TRUE: *"secrets stored in NexusAI's own state are AES-256-GCM-encrypted with a Key Vault-managed key."*** RD-518 was already in the minimum set, so the queue does not change — but it is now his word rather than Tuesday's inference, and **the package email says so.** Relayed to S72 19:43Z; **the C-number is OWED back and closes the relay.**

**2. 19:41:12 — `tuesday-t9-disk-full-spotlight-and-temp-file`: WITHDRAWN on his instruction, VERBATIM:**
> *"Decision tuesday-t9-disk-full-spotlight-and-temp-file note: actioned.  remove card"*
Withdrawn (not expired, not superseded), his words in the reason. ⚠ **Tuesday's verification instrument was the WRONG ONE and it was reported to him as such, not as a contradiction:** `mdutil -s` says *"Indexing enabled"* and the index is **13G** (12.3 GiB this morning) — but the ask was a **FOLDER** exclusion on `!CODING`, which a **volume-level** check cannot see. **The real evidence is whether the index STOPS GROWING; look tomorrow and tell him either way.** T9 free holding at **649 GiB**.

🔴 **STILL OPEN AND NOT RULED: `nexusai-degraded-flip-and-live-deployments`.** Both cards turn on the same unknown — **are there live customer deployments** — and he answered the one that did not need it. **So: build RD-518's credential fix, the state distinction and the loud logging; do NOT ship the DEGRADED health flip.** Four cards open.

---

## 🔴 DELTA 38 — 2026-09-20 19:3x. **r3 IS READY FOR QA. THE TIER-1 GATE IS THE NEXT ACTION AND ITS MATERIAL IS ALL HERE — do not re-derive it.**

### STATE
**`rd-464-r3-merged-main-s72` @ `60c76d7`, PUSHED to origin. `VERDICT: PASS — 3772/3772 across 214 suites.`** On RD-464 as comment 37876. **NOT on main; nothing goes there without Tuesday's GO.**
**SOURCE-CHECKED BY TUESDAY at that sha, not read back from the mail:** `1f27b4d` and `34ad321` both ancestors (C-68 both ways) · counts **3772/214 by content**, `_updated 2026-09-20T09:19:47.049Z` · `getLLMAdapter()` **0** · `getUsableLLMAdapter()` **9** · `namedAoaiError` **7** · `AiEndpointRedirectError` **7** · `readiness:'not-checked'` **3** · main untouched at `34ad321`. **Nothing S72 claimed failed to reproduce.**
**The push was RATIFIED** — S72 inferred it from what a gate REQUIRES (a gate cannot run against a sha on one disk), flagged the inference, and offered to reverse it. Tuesday's GO should have said "push and gate"; that gap is Tuesday's.

### 🔴 THE GATE BRIEF'S MATERIAL — S72 supplied it; USE IT RATHER THAN REBUILDING IT
1. **THE DRIVABLE SURFACE IS A LOCAL RUN AT `60c76d7`, NOT THE DEMO.** RD-76 is real: the demo's `/login` carries **zero `<form>` and zero `<input>`**, so no test account opens it. A local run against a fresh data dir serves every page and API in open mode by design (`isAuthEnforced()`), no auth shim, no test-only branch. **Say this in the verdict so nobody records a demo pass that did not happen.**
2. **THE MERGE INTRODUCES NO NEW VISUAL BEHAVIOUR OF ITS OWN.** It unions two separately-gated changes. **The gate's actual subject is their INTERACTION — the one thing neither parent could have tested.**
3. **NO before/after screenshots, and that is correct** — there is no visual delta introduced BY THE MERGE to photograph. Inventing one would be theatre.
4. **The two places carrying the interaction risk:**
   - **`static/js/first-run-setup.js` AUTO-MERGED although both sides changed it** (main +217/-25, r3 +21/-3). S72 checked rather than trusted: base ranges disjoint (r3 318-347; main 289-298 then 371+), both sides' symbols present after the merge — r3's `_aoaiResultBox` **17**, main's `_aoaiPendingAct` and `_renderAoaiPending` **3** each — and RD-549's `d.pending` branch surviving; *"Active immediately."* is pre-existing at the merge-base and remains the fallback for the NOT-pending case only. **Verbatim for the brief: "A clean auto-merge is an absence of textual disagreement, never a verdict. A browser is what settles it."**
   - **The AI Setup step end to end:** save an unconfirmed config, confirm it, clear it; and the Test action's result box across notChecked / throttled / reachable-but-deployment-not-ready. **r3 rewrote that box and main rewrote the confirmation UI around it.**
5. **ALREADY MEASURED — the gate need not redo it:** the seven rd545 cells by name 7/7 · **M4 at the merge head STILL REDDENS** (5 failed / 2 passed; K-switch and K-addr correctly green) · counts read from the file · both predictions exact.

### ⚠ THE OPEN QUESTION THAT SHAPES THE BRIEF — ASKED 09:34Z, ANSWER OWED
**Is a DRIVEN browser proven working on this machine tonight, or is Playwright merely "connected"?** S72 reported `claude-bridge` MCP failing `CONNECTION_CLOSED` at its boot while Playwright connected. **The gate's whole subject is an interaction only a browser settles — so if a driven browser is not proven, the verdict is BOUNDED and that must be known before it starts, not discovered in its report.** **Do not write the gate brief before this is answered.**

### MECHANISM (so it is not re-discovered)
QA tree: `/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/!CODING/Testing Agent MAIN` (exists on THIS drive). Template `2_Project_Files/fleet/qa-agent/BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md` (178 lines, 13 sections) · `gen_launcher_from_template.py <template launcher> <output launcher>` · prior launchers in `fleet/launch_qa_nexusai_*.sh`. ⚠ **Older launchers hardcode `/Volumes/.../WEDNESDAY/...` paths — this is the TUESDAY seat; check every path before running one.** Usage gate at the time of writing: **88% < 95% (this seat's stop, per Kam's "bump yours to 95%")**, so a launch is permitted.

## ⏳ GRANT EXPIRY TONIGHT — 2026-09-20 18:5x. **FIRST ACT FOR THE MONDAY SEAT.**

**TWO rows in `tasks/EXPIRING-GRANTS.md` die at MIDNIGHT tonight** (both dated *end of SUNDAY 2026-09-20*; today is **Sunday 2026-09-20**, weekday and date checked against each other):
1. **"AWAY 2 DAYS: keep going; push, merge and deploy whatever is ready"** — Kam, panel 2026-09-18 14:14:27.
2. **"Ornith q4 ONLY; volume across the whole KS Backlog/Todo"** — Kam, panel 2026-09-15 16:36:04.

⚠ **THE FIRST ONE'S PREMISE IS ALREADY GONE, AHEAD OF ITS DATE.** It was granted *because he would be away*. **He came back EARLY — he has been on the panel and in this seat's terminal since ~15:25 today** (the rulings on `tuesday-boot-digest-outgrew-the-window` and `tuesday-mini-vault-three-unpushed-commits`, and the direct zip instruction at 17:3x). **A grant whose stated condition has ended does not need to wait for its date.** Both are largely WEDNESDAY/SECUURA-scoped (Ornith, KS tickets, kintsugi) rather than Datasec, so they change little here — but the file is read at every boot and the rule is the rule.

**ACTION, per that file's own rule 3 — *"never leave a dead grant looking live"*:** move both rows below the `## Expired` heading with the date they lapsed. **Do not renew either by inference** — a grant given for one week is evidence about that week. If the work wants either of them, ASK.

**Nothing in this seat's current queue depends on either row.** RD-516 / RD-518 / RD-464 r3 all run on Tuesday's own merge authority after a gate, which is open-ended and unaffected.

## 🟢 DELTA 37 — 2026-09-20 18:5x (Tuesday ctx ~70% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **CURRENT STATE — supersedes DELTA 36 on everything named.**

### WHERE r3 ACTUALLY IS — merge RESOLVED and UNCOMMITTED in `worktrees/s72-rd464-r3`
**Every acceptance criterion PASSED, reported as numbers, nothing traded away.**
- Adapter six-symbol: `namedAoaiError` **7** · `AiEndpointRedirectError` **7** · `AOAI_FETCH_OPTIONS` **3** · `startDeadline` **4** · `HEALTH_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS` **3** · `readiness:'not-checked'` **3** — all at their exact thresholds. `node --check` clean.
- `server.js`: `getLLMAdapter()` **0** · `getUsableLLMAdapter()` **9**. **S72 found a SECOND mirror itself** — `getActiveLLMConfig` **0** / `getUsableActiveLLMConfig` **3** — and applied the same discipline unprompted.
- **rd523 suite IMPORT confirmed before anything else ran** (the union on `module.exports` makes it load; taking either side alone makes it fail at import, which reads as "the merge broke the tests" and is not).
- **Counts prediction COMMITTED IN ADVANCE: 3770 tests / 213 suites.** Not yet regenerated. **If it disagrees, the disagreement IS the finding — never reconcile the file to the prediction.**

### 🔴 MY HALT RULE WAS WRONG AND IS AMENDED — USE THE AMENDED ONE
I wrote *"exactly THREE files conflict; a FOURTH means STOP"*. **Three conflicted — but NOT my three.** `static/js/first-run-setup.js` auto-merged and **`backend/llm/azureOpenAIAdapter.js` took its place**, carrying RD-486/RD-523's redirect refusal. **A count-keyed check cannot see a substitution.**
> **AMENDED: STOP when a conflicting file is NOT IN THE NAMED SET, regardless of how many. A file LEAVING the set is as much a signal as one joining it.** Named set: `backend/server.js`, `static/js/first-run-setup.js`, `scripts/verify-expected-counts.json`, `backend/llm/azureOpenAIAdapter.js`.
**An acceptance criterion names the SET, never the CARDINALITY.**

### 🔴 R14 — MY SPECIFIED VERSION IS DROPPED; S72's REPLACEMENT IS ADOPTED
**My premise was FALSE and I carried it from S70's record unmeasured.** S72 measured: mutate `aiReadiness.check` → **R4 RED**; mutate `aiGate.gateAdapter().checkDeployment` → **R5 RED**; control 18/18; restore 18/18, sha256 matches. **Two layers, each already covered — so my R14 was DUPLICATION.**
**The adopted R14:** at the merge head, AI configured but **UNCONFIRMED** under RD-549, a readiness read must NOT probe — `getUsableLLMAdapter()` drops the unconfirmed config **before** `aiReadiness` sees an adapter. Red proof: force it to return the unconfirmed adapter, assert a billed completion appears, the cell must go red. **`getUsableLLMAdapter()` exists only on main and `aiReadiness` only on r3, so their INTERACTION exists only at the merge head and no cell on either parent could have tested it.** Still authored BEFORE the gate.
**R1 gets a COMMENT, not a ticket** (it is green under BOTH single-layer mutations, so it only proves at least one layer works — a mis-read waiting for whoever greps for "the billing cell").

### RD-518 — SHAPE APPROVED, ONE PART HELD, FIX NOT STARTED
Approved: UAI clientId via a NEW env var **`KEYVAULT_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`** (never `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` — it would collide with the printer SP and recreate the bug), credential built **OUTSIDE** the chain; system-assigned identity dropped as a **separate** change; the four-part loudness work; six red proofs, all provable **without a deployment**.
🔴 **REQUIREMENT: the public `degradedReason` names NO vault and NO URL** — *"making a security failure loud must not itself leak"*.
🔴 **HARD STOP, outranks the ticket: nothing touches `wrappedDekPath`, the vault URL construction or the wrapping key name.** A deployment already on `kv-wrapped` would find its wrapped DEK unreadable and the one-time re-encrypt sweep is **NOT implemented**.
🔴 **HELD PENDING KAM: the DEGRADED flip.** Card `nexusai-degraded-flip-and-live-deployments` — it shares ONE unknown with `nexusai-privacy-keyvault-claim-rd518` (**are there live customer deployments**), so one answer settles both. **Build everything else; the flip lands behind his word.**
**Two findings that changed the ticket:** the obvious `managedIdentityClientId` fix is a **NO-OP** (EnvironmentCredential is first and the printer SP env activates it — it would have shipped, passed review and changed nothing); and `encryptionDrift` **cannot detect this by construction** (it fires only on a decrypt FAILURE, and a deployment that only ever used the fallback decrypts fine — **zero drift forever is not evidence Key Vault works**).

### GREEN / CLOSED
**Build `35497286467` SUCCESS at 46m15s — main `34ad321` green on all three.** S71's owed item closed with a conclusion. **C-103 AND C-104 landed; both relays closed (Tuesday holds both numbers).** (DELTA 35's snapshot trap still applies — and it now covers C-104's text too.)

### r3 PROGRESS SINCE DELTA 37's WRITING
- **Counts prediction 1 was EXACT: 3770/213**, committed before the merge was touched, and the +68/+4 half independently confirmed (r3's four suites ran 68/68 against the merged tree).
- **4 red were a FALSE ALARM from an UNSTAGED index** — `git ls-files` emits each conflicted path once per stage, so a one-site census counted three (829 entries / 823 unique). `git add` → 823/823 → 37/37. **Filed as C-104**, with a general tell worth knowing: **compare `git ls-files | wc -l` with `git ls-files | sort -u | wc -l` — unequal means the frame is not the world.**
- **R14 authored and RED-PROVES:** unmutated 2/2 with control; M-R14 → property cell RED (Expected [] / Received 4 requests to the planted endpoint) with the **CONTROL GREEN**; post-restore 2/2, sha256 matching origin/main.
- 🟢 **MERGE COMMITTED AT `60c76d7` — NOT pushed, NOT on main. The tier-1 gate is GO'd at that sha; a verdict is the only thing between r3 and Tuesday's merge GO.**
  - ⚠ **`60c76d7` REPLACES `30f683a`**, which was committed with `--no-verify` and is GONE. S72 disclosed that violation itself, then re-committed with the hook running (1.11 MB / 119 files, clean). **Tree `a68d1847…` is BYTE-IDENTICAL, parents `1f27b4d` and `34ad321` both correct, C-68 holds both ways — so every measurement below holds BY IDENTITY and nothing was re-run.**
  - **Seven rd545 cells by name: 7/7.** **M4 at the merge head: OUTCOME 1, STILL REDDENS** (5 failed / 2 passed; K-switch and K-addr stay green correctly — neither reads the counter M4 disconnects). **Counts 3772/214, READ FROM THE FILE.** Acceptance criteria: server.js 0/9 and 0/3; adapter 7/7/3/4/3/3.
  - 🔴 **A GAP S72 FOUND IN ITS OWN REMEDY, worth inheriting:** its leak scan reported "3 commits scanned" while `git log` listed FOUR — **`git log` omits merge diffs by default, so the MERGE COMMIT went unscanned, and that is the only commit holding its hand-written union resolutions.** **Check a scan's commit count against `git log`; assume a merge commit is UNSCANNED until the flags say otherwise.**
  - **The pre-commit hook is ENTIRELY a gitleaks wrapper** (fail-open if absent per RD-342 option B; `--staged` with rc 0/2/other handled distinctly; `pre-merge-commit` execs `pre-commit`). **No lint, no mode check, no counts guard.** Tuesday's contrary hypothesis was wrong and is recorded as such.
- **Prediction 2 on record before the run: 3772 tests / 214 suites.**
- 🔴 **STANDING RULE ADOPTED TODAY: a regeneration is verified by READING THE FILE, never by the exit of the command meant to write it.** `--update-counts` does NOT write on a failed run — S72 caught that its counts file still held main's 3702/209 after a failed verify, when it was entitled to report "counts regenerated".

---

## 🟢 DELTA 36 — 2026-09-20 18:3x (Tuesday ctx 65% light checkpoint; band 80-90, NOT rotating). **THE FLOOR STATE — READ THIS BEFORE ANY OTHER DELTA.**

### WHO IS ACTUALLY ON THE FLOOR RIGHT NOW
**S71 IS WRAPPED, SCORED 0.96, PANE CLOSED.** It is named all over DELTAs 33-35 as the working seat; it is NOT. **S72 IS THE LIVE SEAT, pane `%17`**, launched 08:07:57Z with its brief verified at destination, plan confirmed at 08:15Z (rung 6), GO'd 08:17Z. At its last read: **ctx 17%**, healthy, working item 1.
**main = `34ad321`.** Watcher must be RE-ARMED at boot on the then-current head — it dies with the session.

### S72's QUEUE, IN ORDER
1. **RD-518's fix SHAPE — ANALYSIS ONLY, mailed to Tuesday. It builds NOTHING until Tuesday rules the shape.** Four answers owed: which identity the container learns and where that value comes from in the template · whether the system-assigned identity should exist at all given it holds no role · **how the fallback becomes LOUD** (half the ticket — fixing the credential without making the fallback observable leaves the real hazard) · what it would red-prove and what would make it STOP.
2. **RD-464 r3, EXECUTED to the shape Tuesday already ruled** (DELTA 34 + the 08:07Z brief). Merge-forward not rebase · exactly THREE conflict files, a fourth STOPS · counts by regeneration with a prediction stated first · **`getLLMAdapter()` → 0 and `getUsableLLMAdapter()` → ≥9 after resolving, any survivor IS the defect** · R14 authored BEFORE the gate · the seven rd545 cells BY NAME · **the M4 arm re-applied at the merge head**, reported as one of three outcomes · then one tier-1 gate, then Tuesday's GO. **It does not merge to main on its own word.**

### STILL OPEN AND OWED
- 🔴 **Build `35497286467` on `34ad321` is PENDING, not green** (npm-audit and Gitleaks are success). **A pending run is not green.** S72 measured the baseline — the last five Builds ran **37.4 / 50.4 / 48.1 / 50.6 / 50.9 min**, so ~44m was normal; **that distribution replaces the arbitrary 60-minute threshold Tuesday invented.** If it goes red it preempts both queue items.
- **`claude-bridge` MCP failed to connect this session (`CONNECTION_CLOSED`)**; Playwright connected. Flagged, not worked around. **If anything in the queue turns out to need it, STOP rather than routing around it.**
- **MINIMUM SET IS THREE: RD-516 · RD-518 · RD-464 r3.** (RD-545 and RD-549 merged today; the O-4 folds closed; RD-550 ruled out and NOT closed.)
- **C-103 is landed and the relay is CLOSED** — Tuesday holds the C-number, which is what completes an approval. See DELTA 35 for the trap it arms in Tuesday's own snapshot action.

### TWO THINGS S72 CORRECTED, WHICH BIND THE NEXT SEAT
- **A handover's "still owed" list is a HYPOTHESIS; the BOARD is the source.** S71's handover said RD-550's rewrite was owed — it had already been done, after that line was written. **Check the artefact before carrying an owed item into a brief.**
- **An anomaly threshold handed to an agent is a PLACEHOLDER until someone measures the distribution.** If a number in a brief was invented, replace it with a measurement and say so.

---

## 🔴 DELTA 35 — 2026-09-20 18:2x. A TRAP IS SET IN THIS SEAT'S OWN STANDING ACTION. READ BEFORE TAKING A CLARIFICATIONS SNAPSHOT.

**C-103 landed in NexusAI's `CLARIFICATIONS.md` at 08:20Z** (relay closed — Tuesday holds the C-number, which is what completes an approval). **Its text QUOTES TWO CREDENTIAL-SHAPED CANARY STRINGS.** Measured in the live file by Tuesday: `AKIA`-style **x2**, an `azureOpenAIApiKey:` line **x1**; file 142,981 -> 147,328 B; "canary" 0 -> 5 (control: C-102 present).

🔴 **THE TRAP:** the card `where-should-project-decision-records-live` has a DEFAULT of *"I take another snapshot at each wrap."* **CLARIFICATIONS is UNTRACKED, so CI has never scanned it — but the moment a snapshot lands in `docs/clarifications/`, that text enters git history and the HISTORY SCAN applies.** That is the exact mechanism that reddened main this morning. **A naive snapshot reddens main.**

**DISARMED, not remembered — the card's default_action is AMENDED** (prior value kept in `amendments[0]`, nothing destroyed): the next snapshot **MUST** be scanned with **`gitleaks git .` — the mode CI judges in, NOT `gitleaks dir`** — before it is pushed, and any finding suppressed **BY FINGERPRINT in COMMIT form**, with the suppression proved narrow by a canary drawn **FROM the ruleset**. S72 flagged this itself and stated the mode caveat rather than burying it: its own scan of C-103 was `gitleaks dir`, defensible only because the file is untracked today, **and it said explicitly that whoever takes the next snapshot re-scans in CI's mode and does not inherit its result.**

**S72 practised C-103 on C-103 before reporting it done:** canary `azureOpenAIApiKey:"Abcdefghij…"`, a value the rule `arm-template-secret-parameter` (`.gitleaks.toml:177`) demonstrably targets — **1 finding, fired by RuleID** — then the real file **0 findings**. Only the first result makes the second mean anything. It also verified all three of the entry's wikilinks resolve (*"a dead link in the file everyone boots into is the same defect one level up"*) and caught its own `[[C-111]]` before it landed — RD-111 is a Jira ticket, not a C-number.

---

## 🔴 KAM, DIRECT TO THIS SEAT, 2026-09-20 17:3x — VERBATIM, AND IT IS AN OWED ACTION WITH A TRIGGER

> **"please email kreiser.org@me.com with the zip when its ready for submission"**

**RE-CONFIRMED TODAY, so it no longer rests on the 2026-09-18 terminal instruction.** Receipted on the panel within the minute. This does not change what was already owed — it removes any staleness doubt about it, and it is the single thing he is waiting on.

**THE EMAIL, when the zip exists:** to **kreiser.org@me.com**, **the package zip ONLY** (no assets — his words, 09-18), with its **sha256** and the **source head**, read back at the destination. It must also carry, because he needs them BEFORE he uploads:
1. **The RD-464 r3 HOLD and why** — it is deliberately not in the package.
2. **RD-549's behaviour change**, in S71's already-written Kam-facing wording, carried verbatim in DELTA 33 — do NOT reconstruct it from a ticket.
3. **The open-mode confirm (C-92)** and **RD-549's upgrade change (C-93)**.
4. Partner Center: set the VERSION field to **2.2.0** and check it matches the file (the live row reads `2.1.0` beside a file named `2.1.1`, so that field is entered separately).
5. RD-536 row 14's two asks (pre-built image vs build-from-zip, default PRE-BUILT; the certification risk, default ACCEPT) go in the SAME message, as one ask.

**IT IS NOT READY AND HE HAS BEEN TOLD SO PLAINLY.** Three minimum-set lines remain — RD-516, RD-518, RD-464 r3 — and RD-518's fix is not started. **Do not send a partial package.**

---

## 🔵 DELTA 34 — 2026-09-20 17:3x (Tuesday ctx 51% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). READ FIRST; DELTA 33 holds except where named.

### 🟢 THE MINIMUM SET WENT FROM SEVEN TO **THREE** TODAY
**MERGED:** RD-545 (`58f87d9`) · RD-549 (`c56f946`). **CLOSED:** the RD-465/RD-454 O-4 listing folds — both DONE, verified in the listing artefact itself, the predicate's last UNKNOWN. **RULED OUT (not closed):** RD-550.
**REMAINING: RD-516 · RD-518 · RD-464 r3.** **main = `8df469f`** (RD-549 + a gitleaks CI fix). Watcher must be RE-ARMED at boot on the then-current head.

### 🔴 RD-518 — I WAS WRONG AND THE PREDICATE NOW SAYS SO. DO NOT RE-DERIVE MY ERROR.
I measured the `KEYVAULT_NAME` vs `KEY_VAULT_NAME` names, found they MATCH, wrote "premise refuted, likely leaves the minimum set", and **told Kam that on the panel**. **The ticket's CONCLUSION was right by a route nobody had written down.** The Crypto User grant is on the **user-assigned** identity only; `backend/encryptionService.js:232` calls `new DefaultAzureCredential()` with **no options**; **none of the container's 21 env names is a managed-identity client id**; `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` is bound to the **printer-data SP**. `hasPrinterData` TRUE → EnvironmentCredential authenticates as that SP (no KV role); FALSE → ManagedIdentityCredential resolves to the **system-assigned** identity (no role anywhere in the template). **In BOTH shapes the credential lacks the grant, and the path falls back to machine-id-derived encryption with only a WARN — a broken deployment looks fine.** The reporting bug (`server.js:631/:642/:17733` reading the unset name) is what HID it: the only surface that would warn says `not_configured` unconditionally, so it carries no signal.
**Lesson filed: `2026-09-20_refuting-a-mechanism-is-not-refuting-the-defect.md`.** A ticket's CONCLUSION and its MECHANISM fail independently. **When a measurement would let you REMOVE a blocker, take one more measurement** — slow costs an hour, wrong ships silent fallback encryption to every customer. **Suspect a "the ticket is wrong" finding most when it is convenient.**
**RD-518's FIX IS NOT STARTED and the shape comes to Tuesday first** — it touches credential resolution on the deployment path.

### 🔴 ON KAM'S DESK — `nexusai-privacy-keyvault-claim-rd518` (carded 17:2x, DEFAULT IS SAFE)
**PRIVACY.md:129**, customer-facing and framed as AUDITED, says secrets are AES-256-GCM encrypted *"with a Key Vault-managed key"*. RD-518 makes that clause FALSE while the AES half stays true — **a half-truth, not a loud failure.** Read at source by Tuesday. **NOT implicated, checked separately:** README's KV lines are a DIFFERENT mechanism (Container Apps `secrets[].keyVaultUrl`, resolved by the platform, never through our credential); TERMS' AES-256 stays true; the listing text makes no KV claim. **NOTHING WAS CHANGED — PRIVACY.md and TERMS are never edited by agents (C-65).**
**Why the default is safe: RD-518 already blocks the package, so the submission cannot ship with the sentence false.** Rec (a) fix RD-518, change no documents.
🔴 **COMMISSIONED, ANSWER OWED TO KAM UNASKED: does the LIVE 2.1.1 (`6fb497d`) carry BOTH the claim and the defect?** That decides existing-customers vs future. A NO is as urgent as a YES (his 09-19 standing line). **Anything touching the live listing or telling anyone outside is HIS signature class — measure and report only.**

### S71 — at 50%, given a CHECKPOINT plan; it has corrected Tuesday FOUR times today and been right every time
Its queue, deliberately small so nothing is half-done: the live-2.1.1 measurement · Build `35496305924` on `8df469f` (**still owed, green or red — gitleaks green is not the whole board**) · RD-518's rewrite · then its handover. **Explicitly told NOT to start RD-464 r3's shape** — a half-done one is worse than unstarted, because the next seat cannot tell which rd545 cells were re-run and which were merely rebased.
Its four catches: the C-74 coupling; my placement that would have armed ~30 un-run cells; **"mail BEFORE push, not after"**, which it coined and I adopted; and RD-518. Each raised when agreeing was easier.

### TOOLING NOTE — `decision_queue.sh add` has a substring FALSE MATCH on "vault"
"Azure **Key Vault**" matched Kam's **DEVMASTER VAULT** rulings and the card was refused. Different subject entirely. Overridden with `_override_prior` and the reason recorded IN the card. **Also: a long `--bluf` with apostrophes fails through the shell — use `add --json < file` for anything substantial.** A placeholder card was created and withdrawn in the same action while diagnosing this; it never reached Kam.

### LESSONS FILED THIS SEAT TODAY (4) + LEDGER (30 rows, 3c archive run, conservation 1073 = 1073)
`an-absence-goes-stale-while-you-compose-the-complaint` (S71 sharpened it into *mail before push*) · `most-of-a-project-folder-is-outside-its-git-repo` · `a-control-in-the-wrong-scan-mode-buys-confidence` (S71's case, and it carries **the w=3 root: I specify using a property I measured, and the property that governs is one I did not**) · `refuting-a-mechanism-is-not-refuting-the-defect`.

---

## 🔵 DELTA 33 — 2026-09-20 16:5x (Tuesday ctx ~45%, NOT rotating; band is 80-90). READ FIRST; DELTA 32 holds except where named.

### 🔴 KAM RULED TUESDAY'S CARD — AND HE RULED AGAINST THE RECOMMENDATION
**`tuesday-boot-digest-outgrew-the-window`: (b) — "Keep the whole read, shrink the corpus to fit"** (panel 16:41:18, tagged `view: wednesday` but naming THIS seat's card by id — **the card id is the routing, not the tab**). Also **`tuesday-mini-vault-three-unpushed-commits`: (a)** — leave it, nothing pushes from the mini. Both recorded in decision_queue, receipted on the panel inside the minute.
**(b) IS NOW THIS SEAT'S STANDING INSTRUCTION.** The boot prompt's whole-digest read STAYS; the lesson corpus must come down until it fits. **Do NOT re-raise the subject** — he has ruled it, and decision_queue refuses a card on a ruled subject.

### 🔴 TWO MEASURED FINDINGS THAT CHANGE HOW (b) MUST BE DONE — both in `learnings/_audits/2026-09-20_consolidation-kam-ruling-b.md`, which is HIS review point
1. **A MECHANICAL SPLIT WOULD DEMOTE LIVE RULES OUT OF THE BOOT.** "Move every dated section to a cases file" would have buried `## SUPERSEDED AGAIN 2026-09-07 10:49 — Kam: "the Wednesday window is between 80 and 90% context"` — **that dated section IS the live rotation band.** Same shape in `2026-09-01_qa-gate-before-my-verification.md`'s `## REFINED 2026-09-05` section. Accreted sections are a MIX of cases and rule-amendments and **only reading tells them apart.** **Every file is split BY HAND, or not at all.**
2. **THE DIGEST IS NOT LINEAR IN CORPUS SIZE.** Corpus 960,266 → 887,534 B (−72,732); by-tier digest 511,178 → 500,655 B (**−10,523 only**) = a **14% return**. The by-tier rendering already omits most case text; it is dominated by **RULES rendered verbatim**, which is what must survive. **So archiving evidence CANNOT deliver (b).** Only genuinely MERGING overlapping lessons can — N rules becoming one rule with N sub-clauses.

### WHAT WAS DONE, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE
- **DONE (worked example):** `2026-08-07_a-check-that-cannot-fail.md`, which was **8% of the corpus alone**, split 77,770 → 10,197 B. Its **27 case sections moved VERBATIM** to `_cases_2026-08-07_a-check-that-cannot-fail.md` (the `_` prefix keeps it out of `boot_digest.py`'s `2026-*.md` glob). All 27 headings kept as an index — a heading IS the retrieval handle. **Conservation asserted: 77,770 in → 82,592 out; it GREW, nothing removed.** Precedent: the `_ledger_archive.md` pattern Kam himself ruled 2026-09-04.
- **NOT DONE ON PURPOSE:** the four merge clusters (false-zeros/controls · representation-vs-source · mechanism-vs-intention · superseded-in-place rotation rules). **Tuesday told Kam on the panel they are written up "for you to look at before I touch them" — HONOUR THAT.** They are a proposal in the audit note, not an action. The rotation cluster is highest-risk: do it LAST, by hand, with the live number quoted in the audit.
- More case-splitting is **near-worthless for the goal** (finding 2). Do not do it to look busy.

### NexusAI — RD-545 MERGED, RD-549 GO'd AND HOLDING ON CI
- 🟢 **RD-545 r2 IS ON MAIN** (`58f87d9`, + the F-2 comment `354d9ff`). Four push conditions met with CI run ids quoted. **main = `354d9ff`.** Watcher re-armed on it (dies with the session — RE-ARM AT BOOT).
- 🟢 **RD-549 tier-1 gate round 1 of 2: GO.** 70/70 cells, verify PASS 3695/3695 across 208. Merge-forward built at **`2c973b3`** on branch `rd-549-merged-main-s71`: one conflict (counts only), **counts measured 3702/209 = Tuesday's prediction exactly**, both `2edde62` and `354d9ff` confirmed ancestors. **M4 against the merge head = OUTCOME (1), STILL REDDENS** — so the 7/7 green is a REAL green, not a disarmed one.
- **MERGE TO MAIN IS GO'd** (4 conditions). **S71 is HOLDING on condition 1: Build `35493756985` on `354d9ff` was still `in_progress`.** It pushes on green, STOPS and mails on red. **That hold is correct — do not push it.** Cap reading confirmed by S71 against C-62's text incl. the tier-1 carve-out: rounds are consumed by NO GOs, not GOs; merge-eligible.
- 🔴 **RD-464 r3 IS STILL HELD** on its own two counts (rebase-and-re-run-every-rd545-cell-by-name, C-68/C-74; and R14 riding it). **Two merges in a row is exactly the momentum that would sweep it through. It does not go.**
- 🟢 **RD-516's work was OUTSIDE VERSION CONTROL and is now RESCUED:** branch `rd-516-cells-s70-recovered` @ `89fbea5` at origin, verified by Tuesday. Design → `docs/rd516/`, cells → `__tests__/helpers/rd516-cells-s70-NOT-RUN/`. **Cells are authored, NOT RUN, un-gated** — moving them into the suite is a deliberate later step.
- 🟡 **RD-518's premise is REFUTED** and it may leave the minimum set. Only ONE tracked `mainTemplate.json` exists and it sets `KEYVAULT_NAME`, which `encryptionService.js` reads; every `KEY_VAULT_NAME` is in UNTRACKED build output. Real defect is narrower: `server.js` reads the unset name so KV reports `not_configured` always. **OPEN, queued to S71: does the KV path WORK end to end?** WORKS → RD-518 leaves the minimum set. Told S71 NOT to build a deployment for it.

### 🔴 OWED TO KAM — carry this verbatim into the package email when the zip exists
S71's Kam-facing wording for RD-549's behaviour change, **already written, use it rather than reconstructing it**:
> *"When someone sets up NexusAI's AI connection, those settings are now saved but not used until an administrator signs in and confirms them. Until that happens the AI features stay switched off and the setup page shows the connection as pending rather than as a green tick. This closes a gap where anyone who could reach a newly deployed dashboard — before sign-in was configured — could point its AI at a server of their choosing and have the customer's own data sent there. Existing deployments are unaffected in normal use: an administrator confirms once, and it behaves as before."*
Plus, if the operator detail is wanted: *"the only visible change to an admin who already had AI working is a one-time confirm prompt; nothing needs re-entering."*
The package email still names the **RD-464 r3 hold** and the open-mode confirm. Email the **zip only**, sha256 + head, to **kreiser.org@me.com**.

### LESSONS + LEDGER THIS SEAT (09-20 afternoon)
- Filed: `2026-09-20_an-absence-goes-stale-while-you-compose-the-complaint.md` (**sharpened by S71 into a better rule than mine: mail BEFORE push, not after, on anything that changes a shared head**) · `2026-09-20_most-of-a-project-folder-is-outside-its-git-repo.md`.
- Ledger rows: necessary-condition-read-as-sufficient (RD-464 r3) · the 12-second stale reproach · **a placement instruction is a claim about what the TOOLING will do with that location** (my `__tests__/`-or-staging suggestion would have armed ~30 un-run cells; this project sets NO `testMatch`/`roots`). Rule 3c archive run, conservation 1073 = 1073.

## 🔵 DELTA 32 — 2026-09-20 15:5x ROTATION HANDOVER (Tuesday ctx 80%, safe boundary). READ FIRST; DELTAs 29-31 are history now.
- 🟢 **THE DRIVE IS CLEAR. KAM DELETED THE 649 GiB FILE HIMSELF at ~15:2x** (he asked for the command; Tuesday's first answer was WRONG — double quotes do NOT protect `!` in zsh, single quotes do — corrected in one line). **Free: 650 GiB.** Everything below is running again. **Do not re-raise the disk.**
- **S71 IS LIVE in `%16`** (launched 05:24:51Z, rung 6 verified), executing S70's run-book. Score it at its wrap; S70 scored 0.95, S69 0.94.
- 🟢 **STEP 0 RUN, STOP-CLASS DID NOT FIRE.** Seven of eight pre-`requireAuth` `/api/admin/*` routes **refuse anonymously** (403, incl. `audit-log/export` and `law-schema`); the ONE that answers 200 is `csp-violations` (server.js:791) — the one the 40-line heuristic called "gated". A1/A3 RED are now **MEASURED**, not predicted. Zero 404s, so none passed un-driven. **Not a submission blocker.**
- **RD-495 fix authored** on `rd-495-csp-violations-hard-gate-s71` (hard check added FIRST, additive; the setup-aware gate KEPT beneath; the seven untouched; the false parity comment replaced). **Not yet run** — its A1/A3 re-run is queued.
- **RD-549 gate found an UNCHANGED test silently disarmed** by an early return in a shared function (`llm/index.js:43` above `:45`). **RD-576 filed Low.** Class SWEPT and CLOSED: 2 files, 3 sites, 1 disarmed. **Fix = the FIXTURE, never the policy.**
- **OT1-OT6 ARE LOST** — S69 called them "prepared" in a session scratchpad. **RULED: do NOT re-author**; the RD-549 gate re-derives that work. Re-author only against a gap its verdict shows.
- **Two lessons filed today** (both W/M tier, credited to the seats): `2026-09-20_prepared-in-a-scratchpad-is-lost.md` (a handover saying "prepared" is a claim about a PATH — **binds Tuesday's own handovers**) and `2026-09-20_an-early-return-disarms-tests-outside-the-diff.md` (+ its sharpening: only NEGATIVE-asserting cells disarm silently; a switched call site counts too). Plus `2026-09-20_a-closure-inherits-the-scope-of-its-measurement.md`.
- **IN FLIGHT AT THE ROTATION:** step 1 (RD-545 narrow re-gate @ `f008d86`, round 2 of 2) was at phase B 37/206 suites, 0 FAILs, holding the lock; the disarmament proof mutation is queued behind it (delete `:45` → security-fixes GREEN + rd503-r2 control RED; both red = diagnosis wrong; both green = dead instrument). **Then:** step 2 RD-549 tier-1 gate @ `2edde62`, then RD-495's A1/A3 on the fix branch.
- **Thresholds still stand at 650 GiB free** — they are floors, not rationing: 1,700 worktree/C-57 · 1,640 verify/jest · STOP under 400 MB · ENOSPC = VOID.
- **Kam:** back and reading. His words today: *"thanks for holding down the fort"* and *"please continue getting Nexus ready"*. **Owed to him:** the package zip email when it exists, naming the RD-464 r3 hold, RD-549's upgrade change (C-93) and the open-mode confirm (C-92). Nothing before that unless stop-class. **One card open:** `tuesday-t9-disk-full-spotlight-and-temp-file`, narrowed to the Spotlight half, housekeeping not a blocker.

## 🔵 DELTA 31 — 2026-09-20 09:0x (Tuesday ctx 70% checkpoint; band 80-90, NOT rotating). READ FIRST; DELTA 30 holds except where named.
- 🟢 **THE DISK ASK IS NOW ONE TAP AND 354 MiB.** S70's read-only census: only FOUR qa-worktrees dirs (`s46qa-5e6077e`, `s46qa-731aa6e`, `s64-rd477-r2-dockeragree-19a479f`, `s64-rd477-r2-red-75ea59e`, 88-89 MiB each) are registered + clean + on origin. Removing them takes free space 1,561 -> 1,915 MiB, clearing BOTH thresholds. Card `nexusai-reclaim-old-qa-worktrees-33gib` AMENDED to exactly those four (prior values kept); **Kam emailed 22:5xZ, verified at origin: "One tap unblocks NexusAI - it is 354 MiB now, not 33 GiB."** The 649 GiB file stays the permanent fix and his hands.
- **RULED by Tuesday: the 115 orphaned worktrees are LEFT** (their `.git` points at the drive's former name, so neither half of the card's condition is checkable). Option 2 would have Kam ruling on a different sentence; repair-then-verify is a later proposal. `worktrees/` (11,066 MiB) is recorded only; `s69-rd545-r2` and `s68-history` are never-touch.
- **S70 produced, all NOT RUN and labelled so:** RD-516 R2a/R7/R12/R12-refused + controls · RD-575 cells (CTRL-1 plant-is-findable, CTRL-2 canary, C1/C1b, C2 as the INVARIANT) · RD-526 cells (M1-M5, **base = the PACKAGE branch `a643fe1`, not main** - the ticket's cited file does not exist on main) · six red-proof plans · the RD-525 census (22 stores) · the predicate re-read.
- **New tickets:** RD-574 (RD-516 reddens RD-523's open-window cells - fixture, never policy) · RD-575 (the purge loop is FILE-ONLY, so `feedback-attachments/` is unreachable; the list-only "fix" would claim coverage while removing nothing).
- **TUESDAY'S OWN ERROR, corrected by S70 and filed in the ledger:** a cell must assert the property that must hold AFTER the fix, never the defect before it - a cell that reddens when the ticket closes is a bug-pin and gets deleted with the fix.
- **Predicate re-read:** still NOT met, and its character changed - mostly BUILT/designed and **entirely gate-blocked**; main moved 154206b -> fdf2483 and is EMPTY for this purpose (zero minimum-set tickets since S68).
- **Triggers unchanged and armed at S70:** 1,700 -> RD-545 re-gate @ f008d86, then RD-549 tier-1 @ 2edde62, then OT1-OT6; 1,640 -> verifies/jest batches.
- **panel_sync wedged at 08:32** on a stale `.git/rebase-merge` husk (autostash only, no head-name); quarantined at `5_Project_History/_quarantine_2026-09-20/`, recovery confirmed 08:34. Fix CLAIMED in wed_claim (arms: husk / genuine in-progress / conflicted).

## 🔵 DELTA 30 — 2026-09-20 08:3x (Tuesday ctx 65% checkpoint; band 80-90, NOT rotating). READ FIRST; DELTA 29 superseded on state.
- **NexusAI main = `fdf2483`** (RD-567 merged, CI green, 3624/205). **S69 wrapped, scored 0.94, pane closed. S70 LIVE in `%15`** (rung 6 verified 22:11Z).
- 🔴 **THE DRIVE IS THE ONLY BLOCKER: ~1,560 MiB free, flat.** Spotlight's index on the T9 = 12.3 GiB and growing (measured). The 649 GiB abandoned Unison temp is LOCATED and confirmed alone in its directory (S70, 22:1xZ). **Both ways out are Kam's and both are on his desk:** cards `tuesday-t9-disk-full-spotlight-and-temp-file` and `nexusai-reclaim-old-qa-worktrees-33gib` (33,651 MiB, a phone tap), plus the email of 21:3xZ (verified at origin). Do NOT chase him; he is away until Monday 2026-09-21.
- **THRESHOLDS (not yours to widen):** 1,700 MiB (min of 5 one-minute samples) for a worktree or the C-57 control · 1,640 for a verify/jest batch in an existing worktree · 400 MB mid-run stop · ENOSPC = VOID. S69's one-run 1,450 allowance is SPENT.
- **AUTO-TRIGGERS ARMED at S70, no further word needed:** at 1,700 -> the RD-545 narrow re-gate @ `f008d86` (round 2 of 2, C-62; mutations prepared) -> then the RD-549 tier-1 gate @ `2edde62` (round 1 of 2; its changed-older-test requirement stands) -> then OT1-OT6.
- **UNVERIFIED, say it that way:** RD-545 round 2's green/RS1/M4 are S69's own claims — its re-gate was NOT RUN (disk). RD-549 @ 2edde62 is built + verified (3695/208) but ungated.
- **New this session:** C-92 (open-mode confirm, reset as a predicate at every use) · C-93 (upgrade fail-closed) · C-94 · RD-574 filed (RD-516 reddens RD-523's open-window cells — fixture changes, never the policy) · R14 rides RD-464 r3 on C-77's re-run list (nothing asserts the billed probe stays SKIPPED).
- **Five old NexusAI rulings were marked `--delivered`** after checking each at source (4 in CLARIFICATIONS by card id; RD-454 delivered as code at 784b831). Their marks were stale, not the deliveries.
- **A seat with no human at its pane must NOT use a modal**: S70 blocked itself on one at 22:1xZ; the detector called it MODAL, Tuesday pressed ESC (never selected an option) and tapped the pointer to mail. Put "no interactive prompts — card or mail it" in every brief.
- **Kam's open cards (5):** the two disk ones above, `wed-allowance-pace-before-week-away` (Wednesday's), and two others. All carry defaults; silence changes nothing.

## 🔴 DELTA 29 — 2026-09-20 02:3x (Tuesday rotation boot, session d63db5d0). READ FIRST; DELTA 28 still holds except where named.
- **S69 had stalled at its prompt waiting for a GO** (its mail said no reply needed; its pane said 'Say go'). GO sent 16:17Z; RD-545 ANSWER 16:20Z (guard cells + trial-collapse red proof + an AI toggle cell). **Rule: always answer a new seat's plan with a GO mail + tap, and read its pane before rotating.**
- **S69 is ON A DISK HOLD (its STOP 16:22Z).** RD-567 merge built UNCOMMITTED in `worktrees/s68-history`; do NOT let it abort. Swing cause = **Spotlight indexing the T9** (measured). **Resume rule sent 16:27Z:** min of 5 one-minute `df -m` samples >= its measured verify footprint + 1,600 MiB (4,096 MiB if unmeasured). S69 owes: the footprint number + the RD-545 cell design as text.
- **Card `tuesday-t9-disk-full-spotlight-and-temp-file` is with Kam** (rec a: delete the 649 GiB temp file + exclude T9 `!CODING` from Spotlight; default nothing changes). He is AWAY until Monday 2026-09-21; do not chase. When `df` holds high, tell S69 to resume under the rule.
- **RD-567 MERGED: main = fdf2483** (verified at origin, 3624/205). S69 now on RD-545 (fresh branch from fdf2483); next mail READY FOR QA -> Tuesday source-checks, then commissions the TIER-1 gate. **Disk footprint MEASURED:** verify 10-16 MiB, C-57 control ~90 MiB on the T9; resume threshold 1,700 MiB stands. Watcher armed on fdf2483.
- **RD-545 tier-1 gate RUNNING** @ 0438909 (round 1 of 2). **RD-549 BUILD GO'd** red-first (C-75 shape; upgrade path RULED fail-closed by Tuesday; confirm-route cells added). **Package email to Kam must mention BOTH:** the RD-464 r3 hold and RD-549's upgrade behaviour change (unmarked AI config goes pending until an admin confirms).
- **RD-549 open-mode confirm RULED (b) by Tuesday 04:1x:** allowed while sign-in unconfigured; reset is a predicate at every use (env-first resolver), incl. env+restart and restore. Add to the package email too. C-92/C-93 VERIFIED in CLARIFICATIONS.
- **RD-545 round 1 NO GO (F-1/F-2 test-side); round 2 of 2 GO'd** - next READY -> narrow re-gate; a Major then is TICKETED, no round 3. **Second disk card with Kam:** `nexusai-reclaim-old-qa-worktrees-33gib` (216 old QA checkouts, 33 GiB; rec a clean+pushed only). If he taps a, relay to S69 by mail and mark --delivered when S69 reports the removals.
- **Disk start thresholds (Tuesday 05:4x):** plain verify with no new worktree = 1,640 MiB (measured max 32 MiB); C-57 control / new worktree = 1,700 MiB; 400 MB mid-run stop; ENOSPC = VOID. 🔴 **RD-545 r2 re-gate = NOT RUN (disk) at f008d86** - items 2-5 unverified; its prepared mutations keep. **Everything needing a test run is blocked on disk** (Spotlight index 12.3 GiB and growing; Kam emailed 21:3xZ + two cards). ONE-RUN allowance given: RD-549 verify at 1,450 MiB. RD-549 READY pending: its gate must TEST 'no assertion weakened' on 6 changed older tests + the RD-555 reader product change.

## 🔵 DELTA 28 — 2026-09-20 02:1x ROTATION HANDOVER (Tuesday ctx ~80%). READ FIRST; DELTA 27 (disk + paused sync) still holds.
- **S68 WRAPPED, scored 0.91, pane closed.** **S69 LIVE in `%14`** (brief verified 16:08:14Z). Its queue: merge RD-567 @ 3211022 (re-gate GO/Low) -> RD-545 red-first (releases RD-464 r3, C-74) -> RD-549 -> RD-516. S69's PLAN CONFIRMATION (16:12:15Z) VERIFIED = rung 6 (see today's note). Next from S69: MERGED RD-567, then RD-545 READY FOR QA (Tuesday GOs its tier-1 gate after a source check).
- **NexusAI main = `246f23a`.** Predicate NOT met; all remaining minimum-set work is ours. Nothing owed to Kam on NexusAI until the zip exists.
- **Disk:** T9 at ~1.2 GiB free until Kam deletes the 649 GiB sync temp (emailed 01:2x). S69 has a stop-under-400-MB rule. `com.tuesday.nassync` PAUSED; its fix is claimed (seat resolution + Docker disk ignore) - do it with arms before re-arming.
- **Re-arm at boot:** `2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh <current main> 60 180` (armed on 246f23a).
- **Today's scores:** S67 0.90, S68 0.91; gates 1.00 x4. Ledger rows this seat (09-19): typed clock caught pre-send; diff-stat read as content (merge 3a); Kam's praise.

## 🔴 DELTA 27 — 2026-09-20 01:2x. READ FIRST.
- **T9 DRIVE FULL** (1.0 GiB free of 931). Cause: a 649 GiB Unison temp copy of Docker's disk at `!CODING/Docker - Containers/DockerDesktop/.unison.Docker.raw.<hash>.unison.tmp`, written by THIS seat's `com.tuesday.nassync` on 09-19. NOT Docker's live disk (that is on the internal drive). **Kam emailed 01:2x to delete it (his hands; no-delete rule). Check `df -h /Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD` at boot.**
- **`com.tuesday.nassync` is PAUSED (unloaded, plist kept).** Do NOT re-arm until (1) it resolves THIS seat (it ran as agent=wednesday: same family as the close-ritual fix 6c360618a) and (2) it ignores Docker's disk image. Claimed in wed_claim. Re-arm: `launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tuesday.nassync.plist`.
- **NexusAI:** main `154206b` (all merges today + history docs). Predicate NOT met; next builds (ours): RD-545 -> RD-549 -> RD-516. RD-567 r2 re-gate running. **S68 at ctx 81%, wrapping** -> verify its wrap on disk, score, close %13, launch S69 from HANDOVER-S68.

## 🔵 DELTA 26 — 2026-09-19 20:3x (Tuesday ctx 70% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90). READ FIRST; supersedes DELTA 25 on the queue.
- **NexusAI main = `7589489`** (counts 3502/198 read at origin). On main today: RD-436 r4 (1571cbb) · RD-490 (c163db6 + counts fix 9f91eaf) · RD-491 (1a9ada3) · RD-568 harness (acec3ec) · RD-566 recipe (7589489). Every push was preceded by green CI on the previous main (quoted in S68's MERGED mails; 1a9ada3 went red on a port race and passed on ONE measurement re-run).
- **Next, in order (S68, %13):** RD-571 bindable ports (gate GO WITH FINDINGS, worst Minor) merges fresh onto 7589489 after its Build is green -> **merge 2 RD-486 redone fresh** (C-87 BACKLOG union; C-90 if RD-491's renames show) -> RD-503 -> RD-567 (tier-2 gate first) -> history docs merge. **RD-464 r3 HELD** (C-74).
- **Band move (RD-573 F-A2: the 39000 test band sits inside Linux's ephemeral range):** AFTER the queue, UNLESS main's CI shows another bind race - then it jumps the queue.
- **Rules added today in NexusAI CLARIFICATIONS:** C-85/C-86 (Kam: merge everything else; RD-564 deliberate hole, round 5 cancelled) · C-87 BACKLOG add-only union · C-89 pre-push content check · C-90 pass 3 with parents swapped. zsh: always "${sha}:refs/..." / "${H}:path".
- **Scores today:** S67 0.90 · round-4 gate 1.00 · tier-2 RD-568/566 gate 1.00 · RD-571 gate 1.00. **S68 to score at its wrap** (strong disclosure; three self-caught instrument errors: unstaged counts, unlocked c57, stale red-proof claim).
- **OWED TO KAM:** one email when the submission zip exists (zip only, sha256 + head, kreiser.org@me.com), naming the RD-464 r3 hold. Nothing else unless stop-class.
- **Re-arm at boot:** `2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh <current main> 60 180` (armed on 7589489 ~20:34).

## 🔵 DELTA 25 — 2026-09-19 16:2x (Tuesday ctx 65% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). READ FIRST; supersedes DELTA 22-24 on the queue.
### NexusAI S68 (%13), queue state — every head below was read at origin by Tuesday
- **main = `9f91eaf`** (counts 3490/196, CONTENT read at origin). Merged: **1** RD-436 r4 (+RD-561) `1571cbb` · **3a** RD-490 `c163db6` (committed with PLACEHOLDER counts - S68's error - fixed forward by `9f91eaf`).
- **3b RD-491:** committed LOCALLY `c0f45bf` (quiet locked re-run PASS 3495/196, the 10 earlier-failed cells named); pushes only after the Build on 9f91eaf (35423848380) is green.
- **Tier-2 gate RUNNING:** RD-568 harness fix @ `6890738` + RD-566 @ `50d46e5`; its verdict must list and re-run every run that overlapped S68's unlocked windows (04:21:59-04:40:54Z; ~05:2x-06:01:52Z).
- **Then:** RD-568 merges -> **merge 2 RD-486 REDONE FRESH** (BACKLOG union per C-87) -> **4** RD-503 -> RD-567 (needs its tier-2 gate; after RD-503) -> **6** history docs merge. **RD-464 r3 HELD** (C-74, no RD-545). **Round 5 CANCELLED; RD-564 Declined/accepted-risk** (Kam 02:29:33Z, C-86).
- **Rules adopted today (NexusAI C-numbers):** C-87 BACKLOG.md add-only union · C-89 before every push: `git diff --quiet HEAD` + `git show HEAD:scripts/verify-expected-counts.json` = regenerated numbers · c57 control REFUSES without the jest lock (seat tooling, exit 64, red both ways). **Tuesday's side:** check generated files by CONTENT at origin, never a diff stat (ledger row today).
- **Tickets new today:** RD-563 (Medium) · RD-564 Declined · RD-565..567 · RD-568 (harness; item 2 = the leaking test file) · RD-569 (Low hardening) · RD-570 (c57 control).
- **OWED TO KAM:** one email when the submission package zip exists (zip only, sha256 + head, to kreiser.org@me.com), naming the RD-464 r3 hold. Nothing before unless stop-class.
- **Re-arm at boot:** `2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh <current main> 60 180` (armed on 9f91eaf ~15:25).
- **S68 score so far (for its wrap):** strong verification and disclosure; two self-caught instrument errors (unstaged counts on 3a; unlocked c57 runs).

## 🔵 DELTA 24 — 2026-09-19 12:3x. READ FIRST; supersedes DELTA 23 on ROUND 5.
- **KAM 02:29:33Z (email, auth pass): "Leave it as a deliberate hole"** = RD-564 ACCEPTED, **ROUND 5 CANCELLED** (Tuesday's reading, read back to him in a reply; his word reverses it). S68 told by SUPERSEDES mail: record **C-86** (supersedes C-85's round-5 clause), RD-564 to accepted-risk with his words, predicate re-evaluated WITHOUT RD-564, RD-566+567 get ONE tier-2 gate after merge 4.
- **Merge queue unchanged** (1 RD-436 r4 -> 2 RD-486 -> 3 RD-490/491 -> 4 RD-503 -> 5 RD-566/567 after their gate -> 6 history docs). RD-464 r3 HELD (C-74). **Owed: verify C-86 at source; score merges as MERGED mails land; the package email names the RD-464 hold.**
- Kam praised by email 02:28:18Z ("amazing job being so thorough") - ledger positive row.

## 🔵 DELTA 23 — 2026-09-19 12:2x. READ FIRST; supersedes DELTA 22's "round 5 is with Kam".
- **KAM RULED BY EMAIL** (Re: Progress, both spf/dkim/dmarc pass, text in the HTML part): 02:20:20Z *"Do not enforce setting up sign in. This is optional but highly encouraged. Merge every other thing."* and 02:21:21Z *"Do round 5 and get it ready for submission."* Card `nexusai-round4-nogo-selfheal-round5` ruled b by hand; **mark `--delivered` once S68 mails the C-number.**
- **S68 LIVE in `%13`** (brief verified at datasec-nexusai@ 02:25:13Z). **OWED: verify its PLAN CONFIRMATION (rung 6).** Queue: RD-436 r4 (+RD-561) -> RD-486 -> RD-490/491 -> RD-503 -> one tier-2 gate RD-566+RD-567 then merge -> history docs merge. **RD-464 r3 HELD** (C-74 line 710: RD-545 has no branch; merging it ships our own regression). Round 5 = plan option (b) off the new main, with a cell proving a no-sign-in deployment stays open (his "optional" constraint); tier-1 gate; Major comes to Tuesday.
- **OWED TO KAM, in the next email (not a separate one):** "merge every other thing" was carried out in its SAFE form: RD-464 r3 held because it needs RD-545 first. Then, when the zip exists: email the package zip only, to kreiser.org@me.com, with sha256 + head (DELTA 15). The release-image push and the submission are his hands.

## 🔵 DELTA 22 — 2026-09-19 11:0x (Tuesday ctx 50% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). READ FIRST; DELTA 21 still holds for everything not named here.
### THE STATE IN ONE LINE

- Heads: main d881f953 · rd-436-452-501-s64 d5e781f · rd-503-shipped-docs-s64 5700df5 (ls-remote 11:0x). Report: NexusAI `qa-reports/2026-09-19-rd436-r4-d5e781f-batched-gate-report.md`.
- **When Kam answers (email: DKIM + read the HTML part; or a tap: reconcile_rulings.py):** relay to S67 by mail; card `--delivered` once S67 mails the C-number. (b) = S67 merges round 4 under the recipe (13 rd554 cells named, C-57 counts), B rides it, then round 5 from a fresh branch off main; C (RD-503) merges only after RD-436 AND RD-486 are on main. (a) = round 5 on d5e781f's branch, then merge all.
- **S67 interim (01:06:43Z answer):** round-5 PLAN written not built; RD-566 B-3 (JIRA.md recipe) + RD-567 C-1 (test:external bash 3.2) fixed on own branches, HELD for the next gate session (no own gate, no merge).
- **Done this seat (receipts in today's note):** FETCH_HEAD race fix 4fc780e24 (+launcher + _store_guard; Wednesday restarted her loop); close ritual reads the tree-resolved seat inbox 6c360618a (read tonight's `~/Library/Logs/tuesday_close.out` for tuesday-agent@ — the full 23:00 run is UNTESTED); the Studio's stray Datasec__HPSM entry quarantined by Wednesday at DevMASTER/WEDNESDAY/5_Project_History/_quarantine_2026-09-19/ (compare with HPSM's latest wrap when it syncs here; low priority).
- **Re-arm at boot:** `2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh <current main> 60 180` (armed 09:0x on d881f953, expires ~12:0x).

## 🔵 DELTA 21 — 2026-09-19 08:5x ROTATION HANDOVER (Tuesday ctx 80%, safe boundary). READ FIRST; DELTA 20 still holds.
### THE STATE IN ONE LINE
**Kam ruled round 4 = (a) by EMAIL (C-82, delivered). S67 (%12) is EXECUTING round 4 on rd-436-452-501-s64. Nothing is owed to Kam until the zip exists, or on a stop-class finding.**
### S67, round 4, where it is (its 22:47Z mail)
- af36474 (local) = 6b8ca5b merged into fc8ba61; the a8f61b8 counts conflict is being resolved by C-57; round-4 cells in `__tests__/rd436-r4-enforce-stamp-and-status.test.js` (wip snapshot `wip/s67-rd436-r4-1 @ 2a3310b`); red run queued on the lock; fix staged. **Nothing pushed to the branch yet; fc8ba61 is still its origin head.**
- **Ruled by Tuesday, still operative:** the F-1 real-browser check STAYS STANDALONE (tests/e2e/rd436-r4-login-after-selfheal.browser.js): red on fc8ba61 and green at the head, both themes, attached to READY, and re-run by the gate's tester. The fix shape is ratified as a SHAPE only. ONE batched gate (round 4 tier 1 + RD-561 + RD-503 r2 @ 5700df5 tier 2). R3d-NOSTAMP "removed >= 1" or STOP. A Major comes to Tuesday; a further round is Kam's (C-62).
- **Next for Tuesday:** S67's READY FOR QA, then the gate verdict, then the MERGED mail(s) with the 13 rd554 cells named. Then the rest of the minimum set (UNBLOCK-PREDICATE.md). **Tell Kam ONLY when the push is unblocked** (one message, carrying RD-536 row 14's two defaults) and when the zip exists (EMAIL the zip to kreiser.org@me.com).
### RE-ARM AT BOOT (they die with this session)
- `2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh <current main> 60 180` (last baseline d881f953).
### OWED BY TUESDAY (not Kam)
- The FETCH_HEAD race fix across 4 shared scripts: recipe in `0_Brain/reference/2026-09-18_fetch-head-race/README.md`, claimed in wed_claim. Do it early in a fresh seat, never with live panel_sync/chat_sync edits in place (stop, edit, run once, re-arm).
- The 23:00 close ritual (scheduler) reported `wednesday-agent@` inbox counts on the TUESDAY seat. Likely a hardcoded seat name (the 09-09 resolver family); check `scheduler/close_wednesday.sh`, claim it with Wednesday, and fix with arms.
### AT THIS SEAT'S WRAP
S65 scored 0.92, S66 0.95. Ledger rows this seat: R0 digest w=4 (fixed), digest swallowing replies (fixed), R1-CTL endorsed without its mutation (closed by S66's M6 proof). The Datasec INDEX cards are stale (NexusAI 09-12, HPSM 09-10).

## 🔵 DELTA 20 — 2026-09-19 08:3x: KAM RULED ROUND 4 = (a) BY EMAIL. READ FIRST.
- Verbatim (reply to "Progress", kreiser.org@me.com, DKIM pass, text in the HTML part): "Thank you for the update. Please go with option a." = fix first on rd-436-452-501-s64, then merge. The card is ruled. **Mark it --delivered once S67 mails the C-number.**
- S67 is EXECUTING the round-4 brief (merge 6b8ca5b + a8f61b8, the four items, one batched gate with RD-561 + RD-503 r2 @ 5700df5). **A Major at that gate comes to Tuesday; a further round is Kam's again (C-62).**
- **Kam's standing ask today: email him only when the zip is ready or on a stop-class issue** (his 22:15Z email asked "do you need me for anything? If so, reply on email"). **Rulings arrive by email: check auth + read the HTML part.**

## 🔵 DELTA 19 — 2026-09-19 05:4x: NexusAI SEATS ROTATED. S67 is live; S65 and S66 are closed. READ FIRST; DELTA 18 still holds for the card.
- **S65 wrapped (scored 0.92)**: HANDOVER-S65.md is at the project root; history is on `s65-history-docs @ fb2f64d`; RD-503 r2 PASSED and was pushed at `rd-503-shipped-docs-s64 @ 5700df5` (3233/178; awaits tier-2 gate). Pane closed only AFTER its verify finished (pane_close had correctly refused rc 5 while jest ran).
- **S66 wrapped (scored 0.95)**: HANDOVER-S66.md; `s66-history-docs @ d0cd5c5`. Pane closed.
- **S67 LAUNCHED in %12** (brief_and_launch: brief verified at destination 19:45:33Z). It HOLDS for Kam's card after a plan confirmation. **Owed by Tuesday: verify S67's plan confirmation (rung 6).** When Kam rules, relay by mail; S67 runs round 4 and batches RD-561 + RD-503 into one re-gate.
- **RD-562 (new, S65):** the session scratchpad is not isolated between seats (a commit-message file was overwritten by another seat's text). The rule is in S67's brief: mktemp-named files, read back before use. **This applies to THIS seat too.**

## 🔵 DELTA 18 — 2026-09-18 18:4x (Tuesday ctx 70% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90). READ FIRST; supersedes DELTA 17 on round 3.
- **ROUND 3 CAME BACK NO GO (06:37Z) and it is WITH KAM:** card `nexusai-round3-nogo-round4-or-merge`, rec (b) merge round 3 now and run round 4 alongside, before the zip; (a) S65's rec, round 4 first; (c) accept the ~60 s race. **Default: NOTHING PROCEEDS.** It is unruled as of 18:4x (reconcile: 0). Kam was told on the panel (verified at origin). **Do not chase.**
- **When he rules (a) or (b):** S65's round-4 brief is WRITTEN (`qa-briefs/2026-09-18_nexusai-rd436-round4-BRIEF-READY.md`): B-1 enforce writes the stamp; F-1 status ordering; F-3 fail-open cell; RD-561 as a tier-2 section. **The rd554 merge input is `rd-554-cells-s66 @ 6b8ca5b`** (F-2 identity cells; the M6 run proved it: 3 red vs 46/46 on fc8ba61; verified 8 rd554 files only). On (b): S65 merges fc8ba61 plus 6b8ca5b to main first (narrow re-verify, 13 cells named, R3d-NOSTAMP "removed >= 1" or STOP), then RD-486, and round 4 runs alongside. Relay his ruling to S65 by mail in the same action, and mark the card delivered once S65 records it.
- **RD-561** (npm eats `--maxWorkers`; verify-suite now refuses) is READY at `a8f61b8` and RIDES the round-4 re-gate; there is no standalone gate. After it merges, the first CI Build at 2 workers is its measurement.
- **Ledger today, this seat:** +4 rows (the inbox_digest R0 at w=4, the digest swallowing replies, R1-CTL endorsed without its mutation, and the earlier ones). **inbox_digest.sh is fixed (77770bba1 + 6b470ba9c) and safe to run bare at this seat.**
- **Kam OWED, unchanged:** zip by email to kreiser.org@me.com when it exists; one message when the push is unblocked; the Partner Center download is with him (DELTA 16). He is quiet since 14:06 (terminal) / 13:43 (panel).
- **Watcher:** re-armed 08:45Z, expires ~11:45Z (21:45 local). **Both agents are idle BY DESIGN** (acked): S65 ctx ~74%+ (if it wraps, launch its successor from HANDOVER-S65); S66 ctx ~60%.
- **FETCH_HEAD RACE, MEASURED AND CLAIMED BY TUESDAY (wed_claim, Wednesday agreed, 18:4x):** a plain fetch vs pull fails 85/150; pull vs pull 149/150; the fix pattern `fetch -q --no-write-fetch-head origin main && rebase [--autostash] origin/main` gives 0/150. **OWED, NOT APPLIED:** 4 shared scripts (panel_sync :57/:187, safe_push :101, wed_claim :54, chat_sync :79). Recipe, rules and harness: `0_Brain/reference/2026-09-18_fetch-head-race/README.md`. Do it early in a fresh seat, not near a rotation. A retry is the workaround until then.

## 🔵 DELTA 17 — 2026-09-18 15:5x (Tuesday ctx 65% CHECKPOINT; band 80-90, NOT rotating). READ FIRST; DELTA 13-16 still hold.
- **ROUND 3 IS IN ITS RE-GATE.** rd-436-452-501-s64 @ `fc8ba61` (READY 05:33Z: verify PASS 3405/194; 8 red to green; 4 guards held; this seat verified the head and that NO rd554 file was touched after 8ff4963). Gate brief `qa-briefs/2026-09-18_nexusai-rd436-r3-fc8ba61-regate.md`.
- **The gate was AMENDED mid-run (05:54Z):** fc8ba61 carries S66's pre-fix racy harness (PORT_LOW=5240, read at source), so the 12 rd554 suites are re-run at `--maxWorkers=1`; any parallel rd554 result is VOID. **Do not move fc8ba61 while it runs.**
- **AFTER A CLEAN VERDICT (S65 holds it in HANDOVER-S65):** merge S66's `rd-554-cells-s66 @ 6b8ca5b (SUPERSEDES 73a5745: F-2 identity cells, M6-proven 17:3x)` (harness banded to the worker ports; R3d-NOSTAMP added; BACKLOG +13/+6; verified: a47ded0..73a5745 = BACKLOG only). Then a NARROW re-verify at maxWorkers=2 plus the full suite, 13 cells named in MERGED, counts regenerated with the C-57 control. **R3d-NOSTAMP must print "removed >= 1" on the merged tree, or STOP.** Then RD-436+535 merges to main, followed by the order in DELTA 12.
- **A Major at the re-gate comes to Tuesday** (Kam's round is spent). Kam's rulings: C-78/C-79, cards delivered. Kam is QUIET on this tab since 13:43 (local = origin, 440 rows; counts only).
- **Kam OWED:** email ONLY the 2.2.0 package zip to kreiser.org@me.com when it exists (DELTA 15), and tell him once when the release-image PUSH is unblocked (his hands). The Partner Center download is with him (DELTA 16).
- **Watcher:** re-armed 20:48Z on d881f953, expires ~23:48Z (09:48 local). S65 was at ctx ~74% at 13:4x; if it wraps, launch its successor from HANDOVER-S65.

## 🔵 DELTA 16 — 2026-09-18 15:0x: the Partner Center download is WITH KAM
- The tab's JavaScript is still blocked (-1712) at the 15:00 retry. He was asked on the panel to download the published 2.1.0 and 2.0.0 zips himself before **24 Sep**, or to close the dialog and say so. **Do not script that tab again until he answers.** If he says it is cleared, finish it: role=tab "Previously published packages", "Load more" until it is gone (check with a count, not a blind loop), then each file button.

## 🔵 DELTA 15 — 2026-09-18 14:0x: KAM'S STANDING INSTRUCTION, AN OWED ACTION (terminal, verbatim; processing time from date)
> "Thanks. In that case, please email me the zip file that needs to be uploaded to the marketplace. I only email the package zip, not any of the assets."
- **The zip does NOT exist yet** (measured 14:0x: no *2.2.0*.zip under the NexusAI project; control: 2 older plan zips found). He was told on the panel and in the terminal.
- **SAFE FORM, carried until done (never an open question):** the moment the release gate passes and the 2.2.0 package zip is built, email THAT ONE FILE, the package zip only, no screenshots, PDFs or other listing assets, to **kreiser.org@me.com (SUPERSEDES the Datasec address: Kam, terminal ~14:0x, verbatim "This time, send it to kreiserr.org", read as kreiser.org@me.com, his address on record; stated to him)** (Datasec work goes to the Datasec address; that is Tuesday's reading, stated to him). Send from tuesday-agent@ with the file name, its sha256 and the head it was built from in the body, and check the attachment arrived by reading the message back. It is also step "zip exists" in UNBLOCK-PREDICATE.md.

## 🔵 DELTA 14 — 2026-09-18 13:4x: KAM RULED BOTH CARDS. READ FIRST; DELTA 13 still holds for everything else.
- **Round 3 = (a)** (panel tap 13:42:46, plus Tuesday's TERMINAL line "Go with your recommendation."; the terminal line is in no panel tool). **Live listing RD-549 = (b)** (panel tap 13:43:05): the listing stays up and the fix ships in the resubmission; no notice goes out. Both cards were ruled in decision_queue by this seat. **Mark each `--delivered` only once S65 mails the C-numbers and the ticket comments** (RD-554 and RD-549).
- **S65 briefed 03:44:45Z** (verified at the inbox, tapped): record both rulings, then round 3 per the amended scope, with S66's RD-554 cells as acceptance. S65 was at ctx 74%: its plan line says whether it uses a builder subagent or hands over (then launch the successor from HANDOVER-S65). A Major at the round-3 re-gate comes to Tuesday; the round cap is now spent.
- **Nothing of Kam's gates the zip any more.** Next time to tell him anything: when the UNBLOCK-PREDICATE ticks (his push), or on a stop-class finding.

## 🔵 DELTA 13 — 2026-09-18 13:0x (Tuesday ~55% CHECKPOINT after the 12:41 rotation boot; band 80-90, NOT rotating). READ FIRST, then DELTA 12, which still holds for NexusAI.

- **NexusAI unchanged: everything main-side waits on KAM's two cards** (`nexusai-rd436-round3-authorise`, default NOTHING PROCEEDS; `nexusai-rd549-live-211-exfiltration`, NO default). Do not chase. `origin/main = d881f953`.
- **WATCHER re-armed by this seat at 02:43:44Z** on `d881f953` (it had died with the previous session): `2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh <head> 60 180`. **re-armed 20:48Z on d881f953, expires ~23:48Z (09:48 local); RE-ARM FROM THE CURRENT HEAD if it has.**
- **S66's C2 measurement ruled** (ANSWER 02:50:35Z, verified at datasec-nexusai@, tapped): C2 runs on BOTH boot branches; C10 accepted (the product dials the planted host at BOOT, so "inert" holds from PROCESS START; S65 records it in C-75); **every RD-549 cell's first assertion is that the plant PERSISTED** (the CSRF 403 trap otherwise yields a false GREEN); **RD-550, a symmetry edit to the local-DB loader, or a lazy model-config read must NOT land before RD-549's remedy**, written on both tickets. Duty-2 source check done by this seat at `d881f95` (server.js :3785/:3914/:4315/:4380, model-config.js :207).
- **TOOLING, shipped and closed with Wednesday (both claims released):** `fleet/inbox_digest.sh` (a) `77770bba1`: the Tuesday seat sees only `Datasec/` rows on coagent@, the rest as a count (R0, ledger w=4); (b) `6b470ba9c`: the Tuesday seat decides own-outbound by FROM, since the subject prefix had swallowed Wednesday's replies. **So the bare digest is safe to use again at this seat.** Her mirror is `427ae7d5c`. Her arms file hardcodes /Volumes/DevMASTER (she has been told).
- **STILL OWED by this seat: the Partner Center published-package download before 24 Sep** (route in the 📌 section below). Chrome probe at 12:5x: 1 window, a Partner Center tab already open. **Never script System Events** (it timed out -1712); Chrome's own AppleScript dictionary answered fine.
- **Not read at this boot, said plainly:** yesterday's note (the pickup carries it) and INDEX.md (the Datasec cards are stale: NexusAI 09-12, HPSM 09-10).

## 🔵 DELTA 12 — 2026-09-18 12:38 ROTATION HANDOVER (Tuesday ~80%, rotating at a safe boundary). READ FIRST; DELTA 11 superseded.

### THE WHOLE DAY IN ONE LINE
**Everything main-side is blocked on KAM. Two cards on his desk, no agent question open, nothing else gates anything.**

### 🔴 HIS TWO CARDS — do not chase, do not default
1. **`nexusai-rd436-round3-authorise`** — RD-436+535 came back **NO GO** (Blocker RD-554 + 2 Majors RD-555).
   **C-62 reserves a third round to him** (`CLARIFICATIONS.md:573`, read at source). Rec (a) scoped round 3.
   **Default = NOTHING PROCEEDS.** Prior-ruling gate refused it first; the closest prior card was opened
   (different class, delivered) and the override reason is in the BLUF.
2. **`nexusai-rd549-live-211-exfiltration`** — **NO DEFAULT, deliberately.** Amended twice today: the plant
   is **restored on every boot** (Marketplace path), and **RD-554 is a THIRD live exposure, worse in kind —
   an anonymous stranger gets an ADMIN ACCOUNT on a CONFIGURED deployment.**
   `nexusai-rd535-…` is SUBORDINATED to it; its "nothing changes" default must not be read as pre-answering.
- **Kam is genuinely quiet on this tab since 09:49** — settled by pulling and re-running the rulings check, not inferred.

### THE ZIP (his named deliverable) — `reference/2026-09-18_nexusai-zip-chain/UNBLOCK-PREDICATE.md`
- ✅ version **2.2.0 = his ruling** (TERMINAL, invisible to every panel tool) · ✅ **RD-529 O-8 on main, CI all green**
- ⬜ **the minimum set** — and **RD-549 + RD-545 are IN it**; RD-464 r3 is coupled to RD-545, so **there is no safe drop candidate left.**
- **Push waits on step 10 ONLY.** Evaluate on `origin/main`, never a branch. **Tell him nothing until every box ticks.**

### STATE — `origin/main = d881f953` (RD-529 O-8 only)
- **GATED GO, DO NOT RE-GATE:** RD-486+523 @ `2d83967` (held behind RD-436 — *the release image is built from main*) ·
  RD-490 @ `23efec8` · RD-491 @ `0c8db0c` (re-verification passed, B6 red at the new head) ·
  **RD-464 r3 @ `1f27b4d` GO WITH FINDINGS** (4 Minors RD-556; merges after RD-486, never before RD-545).
- **Not main-side, still moving:** RD-503 r2 verify on the lock · RD-505 removal @ `a643fe1` folded into the
  release gate (its 3 required cells are in the predicate + `qa-briefs/RELEASE-GATE-package-REQUIREMENTS.md`) ·
  RD-516 design done · **RD-549 cell design C1-C9 delivered**, C2's expected-red commissioned as a measurement.
- **Both seats know the chain is on Kam and neither is pre-empting him.**

### THE WAKE — armed, and it fired once today and worked
`2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh <head> 60 180` on **`d881f953`**. **If expired, RE-ARM FROM THE CURRENT HEAD.**

### RULES THIS SESSION EARNED — they bind the next seat
- **An explanation of why a fix works is a CLAIM** — red proof or marked UNVERIFIED; **its author is the last person who can catch it.** (Two were mine; one was a load-bearing security premise.)
- **"main moved" ≠ "main moved in a way that reaches my cells"** — the discriminator is the DIFF, not the SHA.
- **Verify every push AT ORIGIN** — `panel_sync` commits every minute, so a push is a RACE and "Everything up-to-date" is indistinguishable from a rejection.
- **In a mail to one agent, "you" is reserved for what THAT agent did.**
- **A guard built from "what is missing here?" cannot see "what used to be here and is gone."**

### DEFAULT IF THIS SEAT DIES
Read OWED 0 / 0a / 0⚠ → re-arm the watcher → answer agent mail → **tell Kam nothing about the push until the predicate ticks, and do not chase his cards.**

## 🔵 DELTA 11 (SUPERSEDED by DELTA 12) — 2026-09-18 12:12 (Tuesday 70% CHECKPOINT; band is 80-90, NOT rotating). READ FIRST; DELTA 10 is superseded by this.

### The one sentence
**Kam's deliverable is the ZIP. 2 of 3 push preconditions are MET; only the MINIMUM SET remains, and the
entire minimum set is behind ONE running gate: RD-436+RD-535.** Nothing else blocks anything.

### On Kam's desk — 3 open cards, 2 on the same artefact, and they are LINKED
- 🔴 **`nexusai-rd549-live-211-exfiltration` — NO DEFAULT, deliberately.** Measured data exfiltration on the
  LIVE listing; C-43 overridden with the reason stated. **Do not default it and do not chase him.**
- **`nexusai-rd535-live-listing-restore-reopen` — SUBORDINATED to RD-549** (same artefact; a ruling on
  RD-549 disposes of it). Its "nothing changes" default must NOT be read as pre-answering RD-549.
- `tuesday-mini-vault-three-unpushed-commits` — WED housekeeping, rec a, default = nothing pushed.
- **Kam is genuinely QUIET on this tab since 09:49** — settled at this checkpoint by pulling and re-running
  `kam_rulings_today.sh` (Already up to date), not inferred from an empty tail.

### Push predicate — `0_Brain/reference/2026-09-18_nexusai-zip-chain/UNBLOCK-PREDICATE.md`
- ✅ version **2.2.0 = KAM'S ruling** (given in the TERMINAL, not the panel — invisible to every panel tool)
- ✅ **RD-529 O-8 on main** (`d881f953`, CI all green: Build 35293779197 / Gitleaks 35293779244 / npm-audit 35293779237)
- ⬜ **the minimum set** — RD-436+535 · RD-486+523 · RD-516 · RD-518 · RD-503+442 · RD-464 r3 **+ RD-545** · listing folds · **RD-549**
- **Evaluate on `origin/main`, never a branch. Push waits on step 10 ONLY — step 11 gates the ZIP and overlaps his round trip.**

### Gated work — DO NOT RE-GATE ANY OF THIS
- **RD-486+523 @ `2d83967` = GO (worst Low).** Held behind RD-436 **because the release image is built from main.**
- **RD-490 @ `23efec8` = GO.** **RD-491 @ `0c8db0c` = GO WITH FINDINGS + re-verification PASSED (B6 red at the new head).**
  **Both AUTHORISED to merge under the recipe when RD-436/452 lands — no further word from me.**
- **RD-464 r3 @ `1f27b4d` verify PASS**, re-gate running; **coupled to RD-545, which does not exist on main and is created by the C-70 collapse** — r3 does NOT merge without it.
- **RD-505 removal @ `a643fe1`** (package branch) READY; **folded into the release gate**, whose three required
  cells are recorded in the predicate and in `qa-briefs/RELEASE-GATE-package-REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- RD-503 r2 verify queued on the FIFO lock. RD-516 design complete.

### Live panes
`%10` S65 · `%11` S66 · `%3` fleet-monitor. **`%8` wednesday is a bare shell BY DESIGN — never a fault.**
Usage 7d **24%** (was 13% at 10:0x) — climbing but nowhere near the 90% cut.

### The wake — it fired once today and worked
`2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh <head> 60 180`, armed on **`d881f953`**. It EXITS when main
moves and the harness re-invokes. **If it has expired, RE-ARM FROM THE CURRENT HEAD.** Never replace it
with an intention to check.

### Rules this session earned, which bind the next seat too
- **An explanation of why a fix works is a CLAIM** — red proof or marked UNVERIFIED; its author is the last
  person who can catch it. (Two of my own today, incl. a load-bearing security premise.)
- **"main moved" ≠ "main moved in a way that reaches my cells"** — the discriminator is the DIFF, not the SHA.
- **Verify every push at ORIGIN** — on this repo `panel_sync` commits every minute, so a push is a RACE and
  "Everything up-to-date" looks identical to a rejection.
- **In a mail to one agent, "you" is reserved for what THAT agent did** — the addressee is the actor you are
  most likely to mis-name.

### DECLARED DEFAULT if this seat dies or rotates

**tell Kam nothing about the push until the predicate ticks**, and do not chase his cards.

## 🔵 DELTA 10 (SUPERSEDED by DELTA 11) — 2026-09-18 11:52 (Tuesday 65% checkpoint, NOT a rotation; band is 80-90). READ FIRST.

- 🔴 **THE DAY TURNED ON RD-549 AND IT IS WITH KAM.** Measured data exfiltration, live 2.1.1 affected:
  a stranger anonymously plants their own Azure-suffixed endpoint + key in the pre-sign-in window, it
  survives setup, it is **RESTORED ON EVERY BOOT** on the Marketplace path, and a signed-in admin's chat
  sends **38 distinct REAL user names** to the attacker. **No DNS control needed.** Identical on all
  three heads. RD-516 allows it correctly by its own rule — it is a different property.
  **Card `nexusai-rd549-live-211-exfiltration`, deliberately NO DEFAULT**, C-43 overridden with the
  reason stated (C-43 covered harm inside the customer's tenant; this sends data OUT).
  **Card `nexusai-rd535-live-listing-restore-reopen` is now SUBORDINATED to it** — same artefact, and a
  ruling on RD-549 disposes of it. Do not let its "nothing changes" default read as pre-answering RD-549.
- **Kam's standing instruction, unchanged:** *"keep going and let me know when the push is unblocked"*.
  **The predicate is `0_Brain/reference/2026-09-18_nexusai-zip-chain/UNBLOCK-PREDICATE.md`** — evaluate it
  on `origin/main`, never a branch. **RD-549 is IN the minimum set.** Version **2.2.0 is Kam's ruling**
  (terminal). Push waits on step 10 ONLY; step 11 overlaps his round trip.
- **WAKE ARMED:** `2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh <head> 60 180`, currently on `d881f953`.
  It EXITS when main moves and the harness re-invokes. **It already fired once today and worked.**
  If expired, RE-ARM from the current head — never replace it with an intention to check.
- **`origin/main` = `d881f953`** (RD-529 O-8 only). **Nothing else has merged.**
- **RD-486+RD-523 @ `2d83967` is GATED GO (worst Low) and DELIBERATELY QUEUED behind RD-436+RD-535.
  DO NOT RE-GATE IT.** Reason: the release image is built from `main`, so merging it before RD-516
  exists puts a worse intermediate state on the ref we build the customer image from.
- **RD-491 r2 @ `7f6c395` GO WITH FINDINGS; B6 proved S66's self-correction real.** Its fix commit is
  not comment-only, so a NARROW seat-level re-verification is owed — **and B6 must redden at the NEW
  head**, else the fix weakened the guard and it becomes a real round.
- **Live panes:** `%10` S65 (RD-436+535 re-gate RUNNING — everything waits on it; RD-464 r3 re-gate;
  RD-505 removal; RD-503 r2; RD-516 design), `%11` S66, `%3` fleet-monitor. `%8` wednesday is a bare
  shell BY DESIGN.
- **Ledger today: six rows**, incl. two of my own tidy absolutes. **The standing line adopted from S66
  binds me too:** an explanation of why a fix works is a CLAIM — red proof or marked UNVERIFIED — and
  its author is the last person who can catch it.
- **DECLARED DEFAULT if this seat dies or rotates:** read OWED 0 / 0a / 0⚠, re-arm the watcher from the
  current head, answer agent mail, and **tell Kam nothing about the push until the predicate ticks.**
  His two live-listing cards wait for him; neither is chased.

## 🔵 DELTA 9 — 2026-09-18 10:46 (Tuesday 50% CHECKPOINT, not a rotation). READ FIRST, then DELTA 8.

- **THE ONE THING THAT MATTERS: Kam's deliverable is the ZIP, and his push waits on STEP 10 ONLY.** The
  predicate is `0_Brain/reference/2026-09-18_nexusai-zip-chain/UNBLOCK-PREDICATE.md` — evaluate it line
  by line on `origin/main`, never on a branch. **Do not tell him anything until every box ticks.**
- **His three instructions today came by TERMINAL and are in NO tool** — see OWED 0⚠ for all three
  verbatim. `chat_kam.json` holds none of them; the panel shows only his 09:49 Key Vault line.
- **`origin/main` = `e0ea198a` and has not moved all morning.** The whole chain is behind the
  RD-436+RD-535 and RD-486 re-gates, both running.
- **WAKE ARMED:** `2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh e0ea198a… 60 180` running in the
  background; it EXITS when main moves and the harness re-invokes this seat. **If it has expired or the
  seat rotated, RE-ARM IT from the current head — do not replace it with an intention to check.**
- **Live panes:** `%10` S65 (six lanes: RD-436+535 re-gate, RD-486 re-gate, RD-464 r3, RD-503 r2,
  RD-505 removal, RD-516 design), `%11` S66 (RD-491 r2 re-gate on 7f6c395; RD-490 GO'd, waits on
  RD-436/452), `%3` fleet-monitor. `%8` wednesday is a bare shell BY DESIGN — never raise it as a fault.
- **Settled today, do not re-open:** version **2.2.0 is KAM'S ruling** (terminal) · build from **main** at
  the merged head, **never** the package branch — it would re-add the `ADMIN_RESET_KEY` route he himself
  ruled removed (C-48) · RD-529 O-8 lands on main before the push · RD-505 removed, RD-542 filed for the
  redesign, RD-536 row 2 closed · RD-543 filed for the checker's misleading refusal · S66's absolute
  worktree-path rule is in C-67 and in this seat's `fleet/STANDING_LINES.md`.
- **No agent question is open.** Last inbound 00:34:50Z, answered 00:36:57Z. Tree clean, HEAD == origin.
- **THE DECLARED DEFAULT if this seat dies or rotates before main moves:** the successor reads OWED
  0 / 0a / 0⚠ first, re-arms the watcher from the current head, answers agent mail, and **tells Kam
  nothing about the push until the predicate ticks.** Nothing else is owed to him.

## 🔵 DELTA 8 — 2026-09-18 10:04 ROTATION HANDOVER (Tuesday ctx 80%, rotating at a safe boundary). READ FIRST.
- **ONE THING IS WITH KAM AND NOTHING ELSE BLOCKS: RD-505.** He said on the Tuesday tab 09:49:55, verbatim: *"Keep key vault in the client's tenant. This is not only acceptable, it's a deliberate choice."* That describes what the product ALREADY does (a per-deployment vault created in the CUSTOMER's tenant/RG). RD-505 is the narrower wizard option to use a customer's EXISTING vault, measured undeployable. Tuesday put ONE question back to him — remove for this submission, or redesign — with the stated default: **silence is read as REMOVE, and the record must say that is Tuesday's reading of his words, not his literal ruling.** If he has answered by your boot, brief S65 accordingly; if not, brief REMOVE and say so plainly in the brief.
- **Kam's standing target, his words today:** *"Don't pause anything. I need to resubmit today."* and *"At the moment we have something in the store no one can use."* Tell him ONLY when everything is tested and it can be resubmitted (his 09:1x instruction), plus anything that needs his hands.
- **Live panes:** `%10` **S65** (RD-436+RD-535 re-gate at 0b910a2 running; RD-486 r2 re-gate at 2d83967 running; RD-464 round 3 building; RD-503 r2 verify queued on the lock), `%11` **S66** (RD-490 GO'd and waiting to merge; RD-491 round-2 re-gate on 194adf0 just GO'd by Tuesday), `%3` fleet-monitor. Usage is renewed (7d ~3-5%), nothing constrained.
- **MERGE ORDER, ruled and recorded (C-70, C-68, C-54):** RD-436/452/501/499+RD-535 merges FIRST (RD-490 and RD-491 both wait on it) → RD-486+RD-523 → RD-464 round 3 REBASES onto that and owns both conflicting files plus collapsing /api/setup/ai-test to ONE limiter (RD-464's AI-off skip kept, red cell on a double mount) → RD-503+442 → then RD-516, RD-518/519, RD-524/525/531, and the release gate. **C-68: a verdict is valid only at its head; when product code under a gated branch moves, the AFFECTED CELLS re-run on the new head and are named in the MERGED mail; counts regenerate once on the merged tree regardless of conflicts.**
- **Kam's other answers today, recorded:** test deploy happens AFTER submission and approval; he submits himself; credential rotation left for now; review Monday and amend if needed; RD-521 legal text DROPPED and its card ruled + delivered. His single list of what he owes is **RD-536**.
- **THE RELEASE IMAGE DOES NOT EXIST:** nexusaireleaseacr has zero repositories and the package build refuses while the template holds the `RD-460-DIGEST-NOT-SET` placeholder. The push steps, links and the Key Vault BLUF were delivered to him at 23:23:47Z; when he pushes, he sends the digest, it is substituted in two files, and the release gate runs.
- **Open cards on his panel:** `nexusai-rd535-live-listing-restore-reopen` (rec a: ship the fix in today's resubmission, no listing change) and `tuesday-mini-vault-three-unpushed-commits` (rec a: leave it).
- **This seat's ledger today:** three rows — the merge line written without reading C-58 (w=2), a fabricated "read at" attestation (w=3), and a refused send chained to a tap and a note (w=3). **Rules now in force: grep CLARIFICATIONS in the SAME command that writes any merge/hold body, and send_brief is ALWAYS its own Bash action with the tap/note/push in the next one, written from the printed `sent:` line.**
- No agent question is open at this rotation; the last inbound (00:01:40Z) was answered at 00:02:14Z.

## 🔵 SETUP FACT (Kam, 2026-09-18 ~09:19) — read before flagging anything about the other seat
Tuesday is RESIDENT on the Mac mini; the Datasec projects and their storage live on this drive (`/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/!CODING/Datasec/`), which is why DevMASTER is not mounted here and that is normal. Wednesday runs on the Studio and is continuously on Secuura. **The `wednesday` pane on this mini is a bare shell by design — never raise it as a fault, and never treat an instruction on her tab as unread because of it.** Cross-seat mail stays coordination-only and should not expect quick replies.

## 🔵 DELTA 7 — 2026-09-18 07:06 (Tuesday ctx 71% checkpoint). READ FIRST, then DELTA 6.
- **KAM, terminal ~06:4x today, verbatim: "Legal text is already in the marketplace. I don't need to rewrite it. Ignore that ticket. Create a fleet activity ticket for things that you need from me, like RD464 and 505. Don't pause anything. I need to resubmit today. So get it ready, please."** Receipted on the panel. Consequences, all live: RD-521 CLOSED (shipped PRIVACY/ToS never edited; contradictions are reported to him, not fixed into the file — C-65); the C-64 usage stop is LIFTED BY HIM (C-66) and this seat does NOT re-impose it; the single list of what he owes is **RD-536** (Highest, 8 rows with defaults, https://team-1634009483756.atlassian.net/browse/RD-536) — Tuesday mirrors it to his panel and keeps it current.
- **Live panes:** `%10` NexusAI **S65** (RD-535 fold into the RD-436 r2 branch, RD-486 r2, RD-503 r2 minus legal items), `%11` NexusAI **S66** (second seat, successor to S64B: RD-490 round-2 re-gate on 23efec8, then the RD-491 tier-2 gate; owns tests/e2e + the rd-490/rd-491 branches), `%3` fleet-monitor. S64B wrapped, scored 0.93, pane closed. Usage at this checkpoint: 7d:93% renews:54m .
- **RD-535 IS A BLOCKER AND IT REPRODUCES** on main e0ea198 and on e57a5d6: a configured, enforcing deployment restored from a pre-Entra settings backup (the C-48 recovery path we tell operators to use) comes back OPEN — anonymous dashboard + APIs, and an anonymous POST /api/auth/entra-config rewrites tenant/client/group. Outside C-42's accept, which covered unconfigured deployments. Folded into RD-436 round 2; its re-gate covers F-1..F-4 + RD-535 + the carried mutation batch; a Major stops (C-62). **OWED BEFORE KAM DECIDES ANYTHING ABOUT THE LIVE LISTING: S65's one-line answer on whether the LIVE 2.1.1 image carries the same path, read at that tag in a worktree with the head named.** Kam has been told it is unmeasured.
- **Standing rule added today: C-67** — `2_Project_Files` is stale by design (measured 125 behind, dirty, ~192 files vs main); product code is read only in a worktree at a NAMED head and every quoted file:line names its head. Reconciliation rides RD-458.
- **Cards for Kam:** RD-536 (above) plus `tuesday-mini-vault-three-unpushed-commits` (the mini's vault copy is 3 ahead/495 behind with other sessions' edits; the 3 are Datasec seats' own daily notes; rec a = leave it, default = nothing pushed). Wednesday measured DevMASTER's vault clean and disowned it; her answer is in this seat's inbox.
- **Still with Kam, unchanged:** RD-464 round 3, RD-505, and his end-of-line steps (release image push, Partner Center preview, upload+submit, credential rotation) — all rows of RD-536. HPSM's two (N-1 round 3, pc-lane-a db-only) are still open from yesterday and are NOT on RD-536; raise them if he asks about HPSM.
- **Mechanisms armed by this seat:** the 88% usage watcher (now moot — Kam lifted the rule; it may fire, treat as information only) and a renewal watcher that exits when 7d < 80%. Neither is needed for correctness any more; do not re-impose a pause on their output without Kam's word.

## 🔵 DELTA 6 — 2026-09-18 02:08 (Tuesday ctx 65% checkpoint). READ FIRST, then DELTA 5.
- **THE FLOOR IS ON A USAGE HOLD (C-64, stop at 7d 88%).** The account (shared by this seat, S65 and S64B) read 7d 88% at 01:55 AEST, renewing about 08:00. A session limit also killed every lane at about 00:00-00:50 and reset at 00:50. **The first act after the renewal:** read the statuslines, then mail both seats the reading (below 88%) and RELEASE in this order: S65 = (0) MEASURE RD-535 (torn store restored from a pre-Entra backup may reopen setup mode; ruled 16:04:32Z: reproduces -> blocker tier 1, fold into RD-436 r2 if same restore path, else own branch), (1) RD-436/452/501/499 round 2 from wip/s65-rd436-r2-6 c4a7d83 -> round-2 re-gate incl. the uncompleted mutation batch, (2) RD-486 r2 resume wip/s65-rd486-r2-2 8e9fd9d, (3) RD-503+442 round 2, (4) RD-518 resume wip/s65-rd518-4 80708a7 then RD-519, (5) lock v3, (6) C-54 queue, (7) HISTORY S63/S64/S65. S64B = RD-490 round-2 narrow re-gate (brief qa-briefs/2026-09-17_nexusai-rd490-r2-23efec8-regate.md; CI green, Linux INK min 0.116), then RD-491 tier-2 gate (08c6128). RD-490 merges only after RD-436/452 on main + re-verify.
- **Wake mechanism for that:** background watcher (task bcwfaffak in this session) exits when %10's statusline reads 7d < 80%. If this seat rotated, the successor must do the renewal check itself at boot; nothing else wakes for it.
- **Live panes:** `%10` NexusAI S65 (holding, ctx ~37%, HANDOVER-S65.md is its record), `%9` S64B (holding, ctx ~56%), `%3` fleet-monitor. Idle wakes on %9/%10 are by design during the hold: wake_ack them.
- **Tonight's verdicts:** RD-460 package r2 GO WITH FINDINGS at the cap, findings RD-526..529 onto the release gate (C-62: residue ticketed; only a 3rd round needs Kam), no merge (C-58). RD-436 r1 NO GO (3 Majors) and RD-503 r1 NO GO (1 Major), seat-completed after the session limit, verifies PASS. FIFO jest lock v2 LIVE 12:58:08Z (sha 8eb95914, verified by Tuesday), its gate GO WITH FINDINGS (B-1 TZ, B-2 stalled holder; RD-534), v3 GO but held. RD-490 r1 NO GO (harness port race), round 2 built.
- **New tickets ruled tonight:** RD-516 SSRF (checklist tier 1 after RD-486), RD-518 (tier 1), RD-519 (tier 2), RD-520 (measure, C-17), RD-522 (C-17 hygiene), RD-523 (inside RD-486 r2), RD-524 (tier 1; via re-implement on main), RD-525 (tier 1, ~10 personal-data stores missed incl. sessions surviving erasure), RD-531 (checklist, with RD-497), RD-532/533 (S65 lane, off checklist), RD-535 (above). RD-517 backlog. Order: RD-486 merge -> RD-516 -> RD-524 -> RD-525 -> RD-495 -> RD-497(+RD-531) -> RD-510 -> RD-492+Q4 -> RD-471/472/487/475/457/438.
- **Kam:** unchanged, five open items with defaults (DELTA 5) + the usage pause was told to him on the panel at 23:28. Kam's tab silent since 16:45 (checked 00:51, local = origin).
- **Ledger tonight (this seat):** w=2 merge line vs C-58 unread; w=3 fabricated "read at" attestation; w=3 refused send chained to tap + note. Interim rules in force: grep CLARIFICATIONS in the same command as any merge/hold body; send_brief is ALWAYS its own action, tap/note/push in the next action from the printed `sent:` line.
- **After midnight:** today's note is daily_tuesday/2026-09-18.md (created 00:52). note_entry refuses if a day's note is missing: create it from daily/_template.md first.

## 🔵 DELTA 5 — 2026-09-17 22:34 (Tuesday ctx 51% checkpoint). READ FIRST, then DELTA 4.
- **Kam: FIVE open items, all with defaults, none re-raise before he speaks:** (1) NexusAI RD-464 round 3 (rec yes; default no merge); (2) RD-505 BYO Key Vault (rec remove; default release gate waits); (3) HPSM N-1 round 3 (rec yes; default upgrade NO GO); (4) HPSM pc-lane-a db-only (rec yes; default stays down). These four are on his panel from 19:0x. (5) Card `nexusai-rd521-legal-text-free-offer`: legal text proposal ready (NexusAI `5_Project_History/2026-09-17_S64_rd521-legal-text-proposal.md`); decisions 1-4 + governing law + the AI data-flow claim (tools.js sends job rows to the customer's Azure OpenAI) put to him on the panel 22:2x; default: shipped PRIVACY/ToS untouched, resubmission waits.
- **Live panes:** `%10` Datasec/NexusAI **S65** (launched 22:33 from `brief_s65` mail 12:33:28Z; rung 5/6 OWED = its PLAN CONFIRMATION). `%9` **S64B** (RD-490 tier-1 gate running on 24c2d43, CI green on PR #30; RD-491 building on rd-491-s64b; RD-490 merges only after RD-436/452 on main and a re-verify). `%3` fleet-monitor. HPSM wrapped (no pane).
- **S64 WRAPPED + SCORED 0.92, pane closed.** Its ROTATION TABLE in NexusAI `HANDOVER-S64.md` is S65's queue: FIFO jest lock install first (arms proven post-wrap), then re-run RD-436/452/501/499 tier-1 gate and RD-503+442 tier-2 gate, RD-460 r2 verdict follow-up (GO WITH FINDINGS on disk; NO MERGE, C-58 release gate), RD-486 round 2 (RD-523 redirects, wip 814a460), RD-518 (wip eb313fd, names-only demo env read) then RD-519, RD-524/525 measurements, then C-54 queue (RD-516 after RD-486 merges, RD-495, RD-497, RD-510, RD-492+Q4, RD-471/472/487/475/457/438), HISTORY entries S63/S64.
- **Tonight's rulings, all in NexusAI CLARIFICATIONS C-54 per S64 (verify, don't re-rule):** RD-460 no merge until release gate; C-60 double key entry; RD-436 applies+503 accepted, Q4 -> RD-492; RD-490 after RD-436/452 (RD-495-first superseded); RD-491 S64B's own branch; RD-486 r2 GO; RD-516 + RD-518 + RD-524 checklist tier 1; RD-519 tier 2; RD-520 measure (C-17); RD-522 C-17 hygiene; RD-525 measure per store; RD-517 backlog; FIFO lock S64/S65-owned, may switch with waiters (arm 6).
- **Ledger tonight:** w=2 (09:46 merge line vs C-58 unread) and **w=3 REGRESSION** (11:10 GO claimed "read C-54/C-61" before reading). Interim rule in force: any merge/hold mail runs the CLARIFICATIONS grep in the SAME command that writes the body and pastes it as READ AT SOURCE. Mechanism candidate for send_brief (raise with Wednesday).
- **Tooling notes:** `cockpit.sh say --mail` fails rc 1 silently for `Datasec/NexusAI-S64B`; tap S64B with the bare pointer `S64B: read your inbox` after verifying the mail at datasec-nexusai@ by API. Subjects must not carry stop/hold/checkpoint mid-subject (send_brief refuses). brief_and_launch needs a Jira provenance line per queued ticket (read NexusAI's .env JIRA_* transiently, REST /issue/<id>?fields=status,priority,comment) + a generated SELF-CHECK.
- **Owed by this seat:** verify S65 plan confirmation; score gates as verdicts land; Partner Center published-package download before 24 Sep (daylight; Chrome in use by gates — new window); tell Kam when the C-54 checklist is empty and the release gate passes.

## 🔵 DELTA 4 — 2026-09-17 19:2x ROTATION HANDOVER (ctx 80%). READ FIRST, then DELTA 3.
- **Kam has FOUR open decisions, consolidated on his panel 19:0x (numbered; he may reply '1 yes, 2 remove, 3 yes, 4 no'):** (1) NexusAI RD-464 narrow ROUND 3 for F-1 (headers-then-stall 300 s hang, a regression) + F-2 — rec yes; default no merge, RD-464 stays open. (2) RD-505 bring-your-own Key Vault — rec REMOVE; default unchanged, release gate waits. (3) HPSM toolkit ROUND 3 for N-1 (migration sha256) — rec yes; default none. (4) HPSM pc-lane-a db-only start — rec yes; default stays down, NOT VERIFIED. **When he answers, relay each to the owning agent by mail (1,2 → NexusAI S64; 3,4 → HPSM is WRAPPED: launch HPSM S51 from HANDOVER-S50 with the round-3 spec and/or the pc-lane-a start plan).**
- **Merged today on NexusAI main e0ea198 (all CI green):** RD-465, RD-477, RD-454, RD-470.
- **S64 lanes:** RD-436/452/501/499 re-implementation (Tuesday adds: measure checkMemberGroups permission; UNREADABLE fails visibly), RD-503+RD-442 docs/licence, RD-460 package round 2 (RD-506 fail-closed, RD-507, ACI region filter), RD-486 on its own branch. RD-464 waits on Kam (1). **Checklist additions today:** RD-510 (boot AI queries before listen → restart loop), RD-503, RD-495, RD-497, RD-490, RD-492, RD-442, RD-501, RD-499. RD-511 measured behind ingress at the release gate.
- **S64B (%9):** RD-490 guard built, red-proofed, queued on the jest lock; next commit → verify → CI-only PR → READY FOR QA. Its gate: tier 1.
- **This seat's rotation:** successor reads DELTA 4 → 3 → 2 → the 65% block. No agent question was open at rotation.

## 🔵 DELTA 3 — 2026-09-17 18:4x (ctx 77%, rotation due in the 80-90 band). READ FIRST.
- **Accounts:** Kam /login'd BOTH this seat (4_Credentials/.claude, 7d 53%) AND the global ~/.claude via the NexusAI pane (S64 statusline 7d 54%, new account). Any new pane launched now uses the new account.
- **Live panes:** `%1` Datasec/NexusAI **S64** (ctx ~61%; HANDOVER-S64.md written; lanes: RD-464 r2 re-gate, RD-436/452/501/499 re-implementation builder, RD-503+RD-442 docs/licence builder, RD-460 package round 2, CI watch e0ea198). `%9` Datasec/NexusAI-S64B **S64B** (RD-490 ONLY, tests/e2e; plan confirmed 18:4x: guard inside verify, PR for CI run only, permanent + scratch red cells). `%3` fleet-monitor. Both NexusAI seats SHARE datasec-nexusai@ — subjects addressed "S64B" belong to S64B. **`cockpit.sh say --mail` fails silently for the suffixed pane name; tap S64B with a short pointer (no authorising verbs) after the mail is sent.**
- **Main e0ea198** (RD-470 merged; CI pending). Merged checklist: RD-465, RD-477, RD-454, RD-470. WIP snapshots on origin: wip/s64-rd436-452-501, wip/s64-rd503, wip/s64-mkt-pkg-r2 (do not merge).
- **C-57 merge control now has 3 passes:** exact; digits normalised same file; gated rename (branch parent owns the new title, gate report cited, assertion counts not lower). Measured-pin rule. Merge pre-authorisation on GO / Minor-Low only.
- **HPSM S50 WRAPPED** (0.93, pane closed). Toolkit main cd69e0f: LIVE UPGRADE NO GO (N-1 sha256), LIVE PURGE alone GO WITH FINDINGS. Step 4 Azure all PASS read-only. NSG ssh source now .215/32.
- **Open with Kam (each has a default):** RD-505 BYO Key Vault remove/keep (default: no change, release gate waits); HPSM round 3 for N-1 (default: none, upgrade NO GO); pc-lane-a db-only start (default: stays down, NOT VERIFIED).
- **Owed:** tell Kam when NexusAI is resubmission-ready (C-54 checklist empty + release gate); Partner Center published-package download before 24 Sep (Chrome often in use by gates — new window, role=tab only); seat_exit.log check at next launch.

## 🔵 DELTA 2 — 2026-09-17 18:3x (ctx ~75%). Read FIRST.
- **Kam switched THIS seat to a new Claude account** (/login 18:2x; Tuesday 7d 53%). **NexusAI S64 still runs on the Mac's GLOBAL ~/.claude = old account, 7d 99%** (its claude pid has no CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR). Asked Kam twice on the panel to /login in the NexusAI pane; **not done at 18:3x (statusline still 99%)**. NexusAI told to make every worktree durable + write HANDOVER-S64 now. **If S64 stops at the limit: launch S65 only AFTER the global login is on the new account (check with a fresh `claude` statusline or Kam's word), brief from HANDOVER-S64.**
- Kam (terminal 18:3x): "great, keep going and let me know what you need". Plan once NexusAI is on the new account: a SECOND NexusAI seat on path-disjoint items (RD-503 docs/*, RD-442 LICENSE/package.json, RD-490 tests/e2e real-browser guard), partitioned from server.js lanes, both briefs warning of the shared inbox.
- Open with Kam: RD-505 BYO vault remove/keep; HPSM round 3 (N-1); pc-lane-a db-only. HPSM S50 WRAPPED + scored 0.93, pane closed.

## 🔵 DELTA — 2026-09-17 16:49 (ctx 70% checkpoint). Read with the 65% block directly below, which it updates.

- **NexusAI:** RD-454 MERGED 784b831 (rebased branch rd-454-group-optional-s64-rebased @ 3abd0a8; pins measured 957; no force push). **RD-436/452 is being RE-IMPLEMENTED** on rd-436-452-501-s64 (keep entraGroupGate.js; strict NONE/CONFIGURED/UNREADABLE/INVALID in the one resolver; RD-499 + RD-501 in it; FULL tier-1 gate). Tuesday added: measure the checkMemberGroups delegated permission against Graph docs vs the requested scopes; UNREADABLE fails visibly, with one bounded retry that never turns into NONE. **RD-464 r2 READY @ 8237526**, re-gate running; C-59 = AI off means no prompt/chat/deployment call, metadata models.list allowed; a comment-only commit (server.js:16182/:17019) after a clean re-gate, range-diff = those 2 lines only. **RD-503 JOINS the checklist** (shipped docs/README.md + SUPPORT.md are stale local-model text; review every human-readable file in the image, read not grep). NexusAI S64 at ctx 51%+: the successor brief must carry today's rulings.
- **HPSM:** NSG change DONE on Kam's signed mail (06:44:55Z to datasec-hpsm@): default-allow-ssh .94 → .215/32 only; port 22 reachable (Tuesday nc, 443 control). Step 4 Azure RESUMED from S4-06; next is the report or a STOP (non-audit diff rule). Option B done: 26/26 public probes PASS, bundle index-B5k6NEu-.js. Fix round 2 (F4/F7/G-1/G-3/F6) running separately. pc-lane-a db-only question STILL OPEN with Kam (default: stays down, lane-a rows NOT VERIFIED).
- **Lessons today (ledger):** an approval email handed to Kam must have every name, recipient and address confirmed by the owning agent first (w=5). HPSM cannot read coagent@; project approvals go to the project's own inbox. Kam's mails keep dropping the subject's leading "[": tell agents to match on the sender.

## 🔵 HANDOVER BLOCK — 2026-09-17 15:42 (ctx 65% checkpoint). READ THIS FIRST; blocks below are older.

**Kam's standing instruction (OWED, 11:2x):** "keep going with all the changes and fixes and let me know once it's ready" (NexusAI resubmission). Tell him ONLY when the checklist is empty, plus Kam-only items as they fall due.

**NexusAI S64 (`%1`)** — merges PRE-AUTHORISED on GO / Minor-Low-only (NexusAI CLAUDE.md:273, S62 recipe). Standing merge rules given today: C-57 counts file regenerated + id-SUPERSET control (pass 1 exact, pass 2 digits normalised same file, absorptions listed verbatim); measured-page-quantity test pins resolved by re-measuring + red check on both parents; any logic/product conflict STOPS. Main = cc07700 (ls-remote).
- MERGED: RD-465 (3c4760a, at round-2 cap), RD-477 (cc07700). RD-462/463 already on main (board fixed).
- In flight: RD-454 rebase → new branch rd-454-group-optional-s64-rebased; RD-470 r2 re-gate @ f15a92a; RD-464 r2 build; RD-460 package branch tier-1 gate @ c7f62f2.
- CHECKLIST still open (C-54 + additions): RD-464, RD-486 (stored key → any endpoint), RD-495 (anon csp-violations leaks URLs+tokens; design ruled: close + strip query + RD-498 log redaction; after RD-486, before RD-490), RD-436+452 (group gate fails open; + RD-501 group-members-only test + RD-499; after RD-454), RD-471 (+472), RD-490 (real-browser banner guard), RD-492 (false "Failed to enforce"), RD-497 (16 admin routes refuse admins), RD-442 (MIT → Terms of Service), RD-487/475/457/438; package RELEASE gate (main merged, deploy-dev.sh + provision-customer.sh, listing folds, real digest, Container Apps digest-ref check in dev).
- REGISTRY DONE: nexusaireleaseacr.azurecr.io (nexusai-dev-rg, Kam's signed mail 01:56:52Z); anon pull verified by Tuesday. Production discipline. Release push only after the checklist merges.
- Kam-only at the end: Partner Center preview deploy, upload + submit, credential rotation (RD-362), any history rewrite of the pen-test key.

**HPSM S50 (`%2`)** — toolkit tier-1 gate: live NO GO (F4 count-not-name, F7 regenerated manifest). Fix round 2 of 2 running (F4, F7, G-1, G-3, F6; O1/O3/O8 must die). Step 4 AZURE rows GO read-only under (a) pin ef9ae60, (b) names, (c) persona — command list comes to Tuesday before the first live command. Lane-a rows: **question with Kam on the panel (15:4x) — db-only start of pc-lane-a; default = stays down, rows NOT VERIFIED.** Rows 3-4 lane-a not re-verifiable. C11 second GO parked for next live release.

**Also owed:** Partner Center published-package download before 24 Sep (Chrome was in use by NexusAI's gate; NEW window, role=tab only). Wednesday: exit-code logging e7db53d39 takes effect at next launch — check seat_exit.log then. Every note/ledger write via safe_push in the same command.

## 🔵 HANDOVER BLOCK — 2026-09-17 11:03 (fresh-launch boot, ctx ~35%). READ THIS FIRST; the 08:2x block below is superseded.

**What happened:** this seat stopped recording turns at 09:03, and 11 wake taps (09:20–10:41) read back "prompt clear" without reaching the model. Cause UNMEASURED. Five NexusAI asks and Kam's 09:39 and 10:39 messages went unanswered. Kam relaunched fresh at 10:53, which ended NexusAI S63, HPSM S49 and the fleet monitor. Ledger rows filed (silent seat w=1, own dirt blocking panel_sync w=4, cross-seat inbox read w=3). Kam answered 10:56 on the panel (verified at origin).

**Live agents (brief mails are the authority):**
- `%1` **Datasec/NexusAI S64**, brief verified 00:59:34Z. Carries all five GOs: gates RD-477, RD-465 r2 re-gate (M8 ruled acceptable), RD-470 (census cells red-proofed), RD-454 (rebased after RD-465); RD-464 round 2 of 2 on its 7-point plan (429 = throttled WARNING; a B-1 recurrence STOPS). **RD-486 ruled a resubmission blocker** (stored key only to the stored endpoint + limiter, tier 1). **Merges PRE-AUTHORISED** on GO or Minor/Low-only findings, under NexusAI CLAUDE.md:273 with the S62 recipe; it mails MERGED. Then RD-476 (side-by-side to Kam BEFORE merge), the package branch (registry-independent), and the RD-471/472/473/475/487 sort. **Wakes this seat:** PLAN CONFIRMATION, READY FOR QA, MERGED, stop conditions, SECOND ASK (20 min).
- `%2` **Datasec/HPSM S50**, brief verified 01:00:11Z. Re-derive S49's state (lane A done 030b0a4 + eafaa23; lane B P3 mid-build 08480af), finish P3 as a NEW revision, READY FOR QA, STOP. **This seat then commissions the TIER-1 gate on the rebuilt toolkit.** No live, VM or tunnel command before that gate's GO plus this seat's word. The S49 brief stands in full.
- `%3` fleet-monitor, re-armed 11:0x (`monitor.sh --once` rc 0, then `cockpit.sh add`).

**OWED TO KAM (his words, terminal 11:2x 2026-09-17): "keep going with all the changes and fixes and let me know once it's ready."** Drive NexusAI through every resubmission blocker (the readiness list commissioned 01:19:45Z is the checklist); tell Kam on the panel ONLY when it is ready to resubmit, plus the Kam-only items (registry, RD-476 side-by-side) as they come due. Not a question; an instruction that stands.
**Owed by this seat:** answer every agent mail within minutes (the lesson of the morning); verify both plan confirmations (rung 6); tier-1 gate for the HPSM toolkit on READY; score merges as MERGED mails land; RD-476 side-by-side to Kam; **Partner Center published-package download before 24 Sep - DEFERRED 11:1x because NexusAI's gate is driving this machine's only Chrome (127.0.0.1:4774); do it when NexusAI reports no browser gate running: NEW Chrome window, click only role=tab 'Previously published packages', download; nothing was clicked so far**; tell Kam, as information, that RD-486 was ruled in (no action from him); Wednesday proposal mail sent 01:02Z (tap delivery via transcript; dirt blocking panel_sync; send_brief read-back to Wednesday) — watch for her claim.
**REGISTRY RULED by Kam 11:3x: option A (dedicated Standard ACR) in kreiser.org (tenant d500ebad), 'set everything up'.** CREATED 01:59Z nexusaireleaseacr.azurecr.io in nexusai-dev-rg on Kam's signed mail (01:56:52Z); anon pull verified by Tuesday (200 vs dev 401). Production discipline from now. Release push after the C-54 checklist merges. Kam's pre-built-vs-zip question answered (keep pre-built). Still Kam's at the end: Partner Center preview deploy, upload + submit, credential rotation (RD-362), any history rewrite of the pen-test key. Open Datasec cards: none.
**Parked for Kam at the NEXT HPSM live-release plan (not before):** C11 (HPSM BACKLOG d704764) — a purge-then-upgrade release needs a second Kam GO between the halves, or his ruling that one GO covers both. Recommendation when raised: two GOs (each half verified before the next is authorised).
**Interim rule for this seat until a mechanism exists:** every note or ledger write goes through `safe_push.sh` in the SAME command.

## 🔵 HANDOVER BLOCK — 2026-09-17 08:2x checkpoint (ctx 51%). READ THIS FIRST; the 03:05 block below is superseded.

**Live agents (brief mails are the authority, all spf/dkim/dmarc pass):**
- `%10` **Datasec/NexusAI S63** — brief 21:40:51Z + ADDENDA 1-8 (21:54Z → 22:18Z) + ANSWERs. Queue it reported 22:19Z: RD-465 tier-2 GATE RUNNING on `afc65e47c963dec804b5dff2e22ad40c84de95c4` (round 1 of 2; three checks added) → RD-464 (red-first, in progress) → RD-470 remove route (tier 1) → RD-476 AI-assistant prompt (Kam 08:13:58 + "Correct." 08:17:37; side-by-side OWED TO KAM before merge) → package branch (registry-independent: remove 4 fields, restore the 22 LOST setup items incl. AOAI one-token check, Key Vault read-back, Redis wiring, post-deploy hints; NOT the Entra-group-at-deploy item without Kam; image ref a failing placeholder; before/after enumeration + red-proofed checks) → sort RD-471/472/473/475. **Wakes this seat:** its GATE VERDICT / READY FOR QA / QUESTION mails.
- `%11` **Datasec/HPSM S49** — brief 21:42:08Z, GO 21:46Z. Doing P1 → P2 → P3 (toolkit rebuild as NEW revision, in-project manifest), then READY FOR QA and STOP. **This seat then commissions a TIER-1 gate on the rebuilt toolkit**; no live/VM/tunnel command before that GO. C-62/63/64 recorded (`bb5e77b`).

**Kam this morning (all recorded; cards ruled/withdrawn and delivered where artefacts exist):** RD-474 accept-and-warn · HPSM re-verify · live listing no warning · Composer Monday card withdrawn · demo order = work in flight · RD-454 group optional (whole tenant if unset) · RD-470 remove · monetisation card withdrawn "old ticket" (offer free now; MS billing later as a new offer; NexusAI free & downloadable by anyone; infra client-paid) · keep all deploy-time config + checks · "see what was built before" → lineage table DELIVERED to him 08:22.
**Open with Kam:** the REGISTRY (A dedicated Standard ACR ~US$20/mo vs C public GHCR) — lineage showed no earlier offer was keyless, so it is genuinely open; do NOT nag, raise once when the package branch needs it. Open Datasec cards: none.
**Owed by this seat:** tier-1 gate for HPSM toolkit on READY; RD-465 verdict → merge ruling; RD-476 side-by-side to Kam; Partner Center published-package download before 24 Sep (daylight task, NOT yet done); ledger 3c move at wrap.
**Ledger today:** the 06:00 sweep promise with no mechanism (w=1).

## 🟢 03:05 2026-09-17 — FLOOR EMPTY. NexusAI S62 WRAPPED, scored 0.90, pane closed.

main = `4148f76` (ls-remote read by this seat), CI green on `d6fe307` + `4148f76` per its run ids (relayed).
Its last turn died on a network error at 02:55; a RESUME mail + tap got the wrap out at 03:04.
**No Datasec agent is running. Nothing is owed by this seat before morning.** The morning boot does the
06:00 sweep, then puts the SIX cards below in front of Kam (RD-474 and the registry/monetisation card first),
and schedules the Partner Center package download (deadline 24 Sep) in daylight.
Owed to nobody: Wednesday claimed the pre-commit exec-bit guard and the missing rotate liveness verdict (her 15:02Z ANSWER).

## ⏱️ START HERE — the whole night in twelve lines (written at the 70% checkpoint, 2026-09-16 ~23:2x)

**Kam handed this seat the NexusAI marketplace resubmission and went to bed.** Two Datasec agents are
working; nothing is waiting on this seat.

1. **Read Kam's cards first — SIX are open**, five of them Datasec and four written tonight:
   - `nexusai-monetisation-model-and-public-registry` — **the big one**: *"anyone who pays"* is
     impossible on a Solution template, and the ~US$20/mo registry decision sits inside it.
   - `nexusai-setup-mode-stranger-takeover` (RD-474) — **the only non-registry resubmission blocker.**
   - `nexusai-live-listing-lockout-warn-now` — whether the LIVE listing needs a warning now.
   - `hpsm-live-release-verification-unprovable` — **amended twice; read the amendment, not the title**,
     which now overstates it. Carries HPSM's four questions.
   - `hpsm-composer-monday-review-scope` — **Kam said 2026-09-16 20:23 he comments on it himself
     tomorrow. Do not re-ask or rule it.**
   - `wed-spotlight-indexes-the-sync-target-drives` — **Wednesday's, not this seat's.**
2. **Nothing may be pushed, published, resubmitted, bought or sent.** Registry creation, the ~US$20/mo,
   Partner Center contact, production, money, external comms — all his, all still open.
3. **The single sentence that governs the package:** *"the zip needs to be self contained. we will not
   give people access to the repo or keys. the intended model is that anyone who pays can deploy."*
4. **Ask the project agents; do not measure inside their projects.** Kam corrected this seat on it
   tonight. Checking their work is wanted; doing it is not.
5. **Tonight's theme, and it recurred five times: checks that describe instead of asserting.** A
   manifest that recorded the defect and never asserted; a preflight that passes `apiVersion
   2099-01-01`; a build script exiting 141 on every build; a live-verification toolkit that passes
   while its probes fail; and this seat typing clocks it never read. **When something is green, ask
   what would make it red.**
6. **Two live deadlines:** Partner Center stops serving published packages on **24 September** (this
   seat owns that download), and Kam's Marketplace preview test is the first thing that will ever
   exercise the bumped apiVersions.

Everything below is the detail, newest first.

---

**Read this first, before anything you would otherwise choose.** Its OWED section is the session's
first work. Until 2026-09-16 no boot step named a pickup file for this seat, which is exactly why an
instruction given to Tuesday used to die at her next rotation while the same instruction to Wednesday
survived. Wednesday read hers out of habit; a habit is not a mechanism. The mechanism now exists —
use it.

**Naming, so the next seat does not hunt:** this seat's pickup is `NEXT-PICKUP-TUESDAY.md`.
`NEXT-PICKUP.md` in the same folder is **Wednesday's** and is updated by her seat on the Studio.
Wednesday's 2026-09-16 mail called mine "NEXT-PICKUP.md (your seat's own copy)", which is ambiguous
in a shared repo where both files exist. Flagged to her in the 20:0x STATUS mail.

## OWED — actions with a named owner, carried until done or withdrawn

0⚠. 🔴 **KAM'S INSTRUCTIONS TODAY CAME BY TERMINAL, NOT PANEL — THEY ARE IN NO TOOL. Verbatim, here, because nothing else holds them:**
   - *"I will do the submission once you prepare the zip for me. Tell me when it's ready."*
   - *"keep going and let me know when the push is unblocked"*
   - *"2.2.0 is fine, keep going"*  → the release version is **HIS RULING**, not Tuesday's call.
   **None of these is in `chat_kam.json`.** `kam_rulings_today.sh`, `reconcile_rulings.py` and every
   panel-derived instrument are blind to them. A successor that checks the panel and finds nothing must
   **not** conclude he was silent — this is the ledger's 2026-09-13 w=4 class (a channel the tools
   cannot see), and it has now fired three times in one morning.
   **The mechanism that catches it is the w=4 rule and it is NOT optional at this seat:** before any
   rotation, re-read this seat's own transcript for human-origin lines newer than the last pickup write,
   and carry them here verbatim. Timestamps on terminal lines are this seat's PROCESSING time, generated
   from `date` — his send time is unobservable from here and must never be typed as though it were known.


0a. 🔴 **KAM — "let me know when the push is unblocked" (his words, 2026-09-18 ~10:3x).**
   **The predicate is written down so this is a CHECKLIST, not a judgement:**
   `0_Brain/reference/2026-09-18_nexusai-zip-chain/UNBLOCK-PREDICATE.md`. Evaluate it line by line on
   `origin/main` — never on a branch — at every MERGED mail and every checkpoint. **A seat that cannot
   tick every applicable box does not tell him.**
   **THE WAKE, and it is a mechanism rather than an intention:**
   `2_Project_Files/fleet/watch_nexusai_main.sh <baseline-sha> <poll-s> <max-min>` reads `origin/main`
   directly and EXITS when it moves; the harness re-invokes the seat on a background job's exit.
   **Armed at 10:3x with baseline `e0ea198a420d4189b3745b6bdec6a94a137675f8`, poll 60s, max 180m.**
   It is INDEPENDENT of every agent's liveness — a seat that dies quietly produces no merge and no
   mail, and this still reports. Both branches exercised before arming (fire rc 0 with the SHAs; quiet
   rc 3 after a full minute of real polling, no false fire). **If it has expired, re-arm it from the
   current head; do not replace it with an intention to check.**
   ⚠ **OPEN QUESTION THAT COULD UNBLOCK HIM A STEP EARLIER, asked of S65 at 00:33:16Z:** S65's chain is
   drawn LINEAR (push waits for steps 10 AND 11), but step 11 is package/template work that does not
   change the image's bytes. If the image is built from `main`, the push needs only step 10 and step 11
   overlaps his round trip. **Until S65 answers, use the STRICT reading when TELLING him** — the one
   thing that must never happen is telling him he is unblocked when he is not — **but do not plan as
   though strict is settled.**

0. 🔴 **KAM — THE ZIP IS THE NAMED DELIVERABLE (his words, 2026-09-18 ~10:2x, verbatim):**
   *"I will do the submission once you prepare the zip for me. Tell me when it's ready."*
   **This is an INSTRUCTION, not a question, and it stands until his own words withdraw it**
   ([[../learnings/2026-09-14_kams-instruction-stands-until-he-withdraws-it]]). He does the
   submission; this seat produces the zip and tells him when it exists.
   **THE SAFE FORM, so no successor turns this back into an open question:** drive the chain to a
   built, checked zip and hand it over; where a step is HIS (the release image push, anything with
   money or production attached), hand him that step with the exact command or link on its own line
   and keep going on everything either side of it. Never wait silently.
   *Commissioned 00:19:54Z:* S65 asked for the ORDERED chain to the zip, each item measured at source
   today and marked OURS or KAM'S, plus the minimum set the zip must carry and the longest pole
   (subject `S65 QUESTION: the ordered chain to the ZIP`, verified at destination, tap delivered).
   **Wake:** the mail runner fires this seat on S65's reply — that is the mechanism, not an intention.
   ⚠ **UNMEASURED, and do not repeat it as fact:** whether `nexusaireleaseacr` holds a release image.
   This seat's anonymous `GET /v2/_catalog` returned 401, **and so did the same probe against the dev
   registry, which is known to require auth** — the control did not discriminate, so that reading says
   nothing. Anonymous pull permits pulling a known repo, not listing the catalogue. The registry's
   "no images" line in CLARIFICATIONS is from its creation at ~02:00Z on 2026-09-17 and is a claim with
   a date on it. S65 holds the identity; it is measuring it.

1. ~~**KAM — Full Disk Access**~~ — **CLOSED 2026-09-16 20:45. Granted, measured, card marked
   delivered.** Kam added the row at 20:33: *"it was not there. now added"* — it had been ABSENT,
   not switched off, which is why six days of "ruled grant" never took effect. Measured, not
   assumed: the isolated launchd probe went DENIED → **OK** on all three reads, `chatsync` exits 0
   with 0-byte stderr, and his board reached this seat unaided inside one 60-second cycle.
   **The trap it hid, in case anything like it recurs:** three jobs still returned EX_CONFIG(78)
   *after* the grant, because launchd was holding a STALE in-memory plist while the files on disk
   were already correct — `install_all_jobs.sh` had said "unchanged" and so never reloaded them.
   Booting all nine out and back in fixed it, and `--check` now reports `LOADED-DRIFT` (559090e08).
   *Kept here rather than deleted because the failure mode — a fix that reaches the files and never
   reaches the running system — is the one this seat met three times in one evening.*

1b. **KAM — Full Disk Access for `/bin/bash` on this Mac mini (HISTORICAL — the original entry).**
   He ruled `grant` on card `tuesday-mac-mini-scheduler-full-disk-access` on **2026-09-11 15:25** and
   it was never applied. Do **not** re-card it: the decision is made, the gap is delivery. Asked on
   the panel 2026-09-16 20:06, verified at origin.
   *Measured here, not inferred:* `com.tuesday.chatsync` exits **126** with
   `/bin/bash: …/2_Project_Files/tools/chat_sync.sh: Operation not permitted`. Same signature in the
   historical logs for wake, close, shiftchange and nassync. It is TCC by elimination — the same file,
   read by the same `/bin/bash`, succeeds from a Terminal-descended shell and fails from launchd, and
   a missing volume would give ENOENT, not EPERM.
   *Consequence to lead with when you raise it:* `chat_sync` is the 60-second job that puts this
   seat's replies on Kam's page. **Until the grant lands he cannot see this seat on the panel at
   all**, and every reply must be pushed to origin by hand. All nine scheduled jobs are dead the same
   way, so every 05:30 / 06:00 / 23:00 ritual silently does not fire.
   *When he says it is done:* kickstart one job, read its `.err`, and only then tell Wednesday to mark
   his card delivered. A clean log is the proof; his word that he clicked it is not.

2. **KAM — the lapsed week-scoped grants.** MERGE + DEPLOY + PRODUCTION (2026-09-07 09:40, 11:09,
   12:07, "for the rest of the week") **lapsed after 2026-09-13**. Asked 20:06, unanswered.
   **Work under protocol v1.3 scope until he answers in his own words.** Do not carry the latitude
   forward by inference, and do not read his restarting this seat as an extension of anything.

2a. **Do NOT card the lapsed grants — the prior-ruling gate refused it, and it was right.**
   Attempted 2026-09-16 20:1x as `tuesday-lapsed-week-grants-extend-or-not`; `decision_queue.sh add`
   refused and surfaced, among others, Kam's own panel line of **2026-09-14 21:56**: *"If you want me
   to merge anything, make sure it's ready and provide me the link so I can merge it."* That is a
   standing posture on the merge half of the question — he wants the link and merges it himself — so
   asking him to "extend the merge grant" would have been asking him to re-rule something he had
   already written on. The deploy and production halves remain genuinely open; if you ever raise them,
   raise those two alone and never as a bundle. Nothing is blocked on this.

3. **KAM — the launcher still pins `opus` only.** His 2026-09-06 override was for one week and has
   expired. Asked 20:06. Do not change the launcher unasked; restoring
   `--model fable --fallback-model opus` is his call, not a tidy-up.

4. **KAM — two installs only he can do on this machine:** Matilda Premium (Spoken Content) and
   Tailscale.app. Listed to him 20:06, explicitly not urgent.

5. ~~**WEDNESDAY — the next-boot preflight output.**~~ **CLOSED 2026-09-17 01:00 by the successor seat: sent `[Tuesday -> Wednesday] PREFLIGHT PROOF` at 15:00:07Z, read back with content. 11 warnings -> 7, none of her repaired items recur.** *Original entry:* Her 2026-09-16 mail asks for every warning from
   the NEXT boot, verbatim, as the proof that the repairs hold. That boot has not happened yet. Send
   it when you rotate. It was flagged as outstanding in the STATUS mail rather than quietly dropped.

## DONE this session (2026-09-16, ~19:50-20:10) — so you do not redo it

Pushed at `56f0a020d`. Doctor went from **11 warnings to 7**; all seven remaining are Kam's or are
facts about this machine (DevMASTER not mounted is expected on the mini and needs no action).

- **All nine launchd plist templates hardcoded `/Users/kam_code/Library/Logs/wednesday_*`** — the
  Studio's home, which does not exist here. Every job loaded, died with EX_CONFIG(78) before running a
  line, and wrote no log. `--check` said "9 current, 0 missing" over nine jobs that could not run.
  Fixed at source with an `@HOME@` placeholder alongside `@PROJECT_DIR@` and `@SEAT@`; renders
  byte-identical on the Studio. **Fixing 78 is what made the 126 above readable** — while the jobs died
  one step earlier with stderr going nowhere, the FDA failure could not appear anywhere.
- **The two boot bugs.** (1) `doctor.sh --quiet` ran at line 281 and `render_claude_settings.py` at
  304, so a fresh seat hard-failed one step before the fix that would have passed it. Render now sits
  before the gate. (2) `monitor.sh` declared a pane DEAD on a hostname title — which is exactly what a
  pane looks like while the launcher waits at a prompt — and send-keys'd its wake text in, where
  `read -n 1` took the "1" of "19:43" as the answer and killed the boot. Now guarded by
  `pane_is_booting()` (the process table, not the title) at both the death branch and the injection,
  and the prompt requires a typed `yes` + Enter after draining buffered input.
- **84 scripts' exec bits.** Git recorded 83 of them at mode 100644, so "restore from git" was a
  no-op; the **index** mode is now 755 so the bit travels.
- **Ledger rule 3c.** 12 rows older than 2026-09-13 moved verbatim into `_ledger_archive.md`.
  Conservation asserted: 940 rows before, 940 after. 51 KB → 25 KB.
- Repo pulled and current; `.gitignore` covers the renderer's own backups.

## Later in the same session — Wednesday's two findings against my own commit

She reviewed `56f0a020d` and found two real defects; both are fixed at `316ed56e5`, with the
lesson at `bd667484c`. Verified on this machine before changing anything rather than taken on her
word — both held exactly.

- **F1: the drain was dead code.** `/bin/bash` here is GNU bash **3.2.57**, which accepts only
  INTEGER `read -t` timeouts, so `-t 0.1` failed on its first iteration and drained nothing — and
  my `2>/dev/null` hid the reason. **Remember this for any script in this tree: `#!/bin/bash` on
  macOS is bash 3.2, not 4 or 5.** No associative arrays, no `read -t` fractions, no `${var^^}`.
- **F1's fix needed a second fix, caught by an arm and not by review.** A timed drain on a PIPE
  swallows stdin including the answer: `printf 'yes\n' | gate` DECLINED. Now guarded by `[ -t 0 ]`.
- **F2: never inject, but always BOUND.** Suppressing DEATH on a booting pane removed the injection
  and created a silence — unattended, a pane stuck at "Type yes" waits forever while the rotate log
  says "respawned OK". `monitor.sh` now posts ONE panel line past `BOOT_BOUND_MIN` (5) minutes.
  Note while FDA is ungranted: `chat_sync` is dead, so that panel line reaches Kam only when
  something pushes; the `alerts.log` line always lands.

**The 19:43 event is in this machine's own log, verbatim** — neither seat had cited it, and it
confirms the reconstruction exactly, including that the occupancy guard put up no resistance at all:
```
2026-09-16 19:43:46 [DEATH] wednesday — process exited (title reverted to the hostname on two consecutive checks)
2026-09-16 19:43:47 [monitor] tapped coordinator pane %0 (after 0 held tries): 19:43 [fleet-monitor] WAKE: pane 'wednesday' DEAD — process e…
```
`after 0 held tries` is the part to notice: the guard looks for text at a `❯ ` prompt, a launcher
prompt has no such line, so it read "nothing is happening here" and injected on the first attempt.
One second between the verdict and the keystroke. `2_Project_Files/fleet/cockpit/state/alerts.log`.

**And a failure of mine, because the next seat will be tempted by the same thing:** editing
`monitor.sh` in place while the monitor was running from it **killed the live fleet monitor** and
took its tmux pane with it. Bash reads a script by byte offset. Restored as pane `%5` with
`@cockpit_name fleet-monitor` after running `--once` against the new code. Rule:
pgrep → stop → edit → run once → re-arm.
`learnings/2026-09-16_never-edit-a-bash-script-that-is-currently-running.md`

## TRAPS this session paid for — check these before you trust an instrument

- **A green check can sit over a dead mechanism.** `install_all_jobs.sh --check` reported "9 current,
  0 missing" while all nine were unrunnable, and then reported "0 current, 9 missing" once they had
  been hand-patched into a *working* state. The checker compared the live plist to the template and
  had no opinion about whether anything ran. When a check and reality disagree, find out which one is
  measuring the thing you care about.
- **`behind 0` can be a false zero.** A cached `origin/main` equal to HEAD reports zero. Fetch first.
- **The local chat API proves nothing about what Kam sees.** He reads the panel on the **Mac Studio**.
  The destination is `origin`: verify with
  `git show origin/main:0_Brain/dashboard/data/chat_tuesday.json`. With `chat_sync` dead (item 1),
  nothing reaches him unless this seat commits and pushes.
- **`kam_rulings_today.sh` shows only this seat's tab.** At 20:03 it showed 0 of 54 for `view=tuesday`
  — every message that day was typed on Wednesday's tab. Zero here means "he did not type to this
  seat", never "he said nothing".
- **The `no_rm` hook refuses deletes outside the scratchpad.** Quarantine with `mv` instead; it
  refused a real `rm` of my own backups mid-session, which is the guard working.
- **The boot digest is 465 KB (~115 K tokens) across 173 lesson files**, and the by-tier digest is
  barely smaller than the plain one because 135 of 173 files are tier W. Reading it whole at boot
  would put a seat past 50% before it does anything. Raised as a structural question, not worked
  around — see the daily note.

## Kam's 20:22 rulings — one applied, one NOT carried out on purpose

Both taps reached this seat only because Wednesday forwarded them by mail; `chat_sync` was dead, so
`reconcile_rulings.py --apply` found nothing and both cards read `open` locally. Ruled by hand from
her verbatim forward.

- `tuesday-one-launch-on-the-mini` → **launch**. Done; that is this session.
- `tuesday-seat-self-rotate-with-liveness-check` → **rotate-after-verdicts**. **NOT carried out, and
  that is deliberate — do not "finish" it at your next boot.** The card was written before Kam
  stopped this seat on 09-14 and every fact in it has expired. Measured 2026-09-16 20:3x: the three
  HPSM gates are not running (`tmux list-panes -a` = two panes, this seat and the fleet monitor, no
  claude agent processes), session 42 is not running, no GATE VERDICT mail since 2026-09-14 in either
  inbox, and the card's "this seat has been past its context ceiling for hours" described the seat he
  stopped, not this one. Kam was told in one message with all four measurements and an explicit offer
  to restart anyway if he still wants it. **If he says restart, restart; otherwise this ruling is
  answered by events.**

## The daily-note split — census DONE, waiting on Wednesday's commit

Both seats write the same `0_Brain/daily/<date>.md` and it conflicted on rebase tonight. A claim
split is agreed (her: `note_entry.sh` seat-aware; me: boot step 5 in the launcher). **Sequencing is
one-directional and it is the whole risk: she lands hers first and tells me the hash, THEN I change
boot step 5.** Pointing boot step 5 at a directory the resolver does not yet produce creates a stray
note at my next boot.

**The census, measured 2026-09-16 20:2x — do not re-derive it, and note two of her four guesses were
wrong in each direction.** The first sweep is dominated by ~60 hits of *prose inside staged briefs*
quoting daily-note paths as provenance; those are history, not readers. The real code paths are four:

| path | role |
|---|---|
| `tools/note_entry.sh:13` | the only writer of note lines; already fronted by `WED_NOTE_OVERRIDE` |
| `voice/speak.sh:39` | **writes the speech log into that directory** — not on her list |
| `scheduler/close_wednesday.sh:158,241,256` | heaviest: reads, creates from `_template.md`, and at **:241 git-checks a HARDCODED literal path** that will not follow a variable change; fronted by `WEDNESDAY_TEST_NOTE` |
| `fleet/hooks/session_start_compact.sh:13` | prose that re-grounds a COMPACTED seat on "today's `0_Brain/daily/` note" — would send this seat to the Secuura note; not on her list, and new here tonight |
| `Launch_Wednesday.command:555` | boot step 5 — **mine** |

**Do NOT touch:** `daily_receipt.sh`, `shift_change.sh` (contains "daily" zero times),
`dashboard/generate.py` (zero), `dashboard/collect.py` (its only hit is `FREQ=DAILY` in calendar
RRULE expansion). All four were named as readers and none of them is one.

**The cheap seam:** two override variables already sit in front of the default, so a seat-aware
resolver only changes what the default expands to — no call site moves.

## A recurring mechanism worth a guard — raise it with Wednesday

The exec-bit warning came back within the hour, on a file that arrived in a pull:
`2_Project_Files/fleet/tests/doctor_exithint_arms.sh`, tracked at **100644**. That is the same
root cause as the 84 files earlier tonight, with a fresh example: scripts are being **committed**
without the executable bit, so every seat re-fixes it forever and doctor's advice ("chmod +x")
treats a symptom. The durable fix is a pre-commit check that refuses a `*.sh` with a shebang
staged at 100644 — `2_Project_Files/fleet/hooks/pre-commit` already exists and is the natural
home. **It is shared tooling, so propose it to Wednesday rather than adding it unilaterally.**

## ⚠ CAVEAT ON THE "UNSENT LINE" RULE — `capture-pane` cannot tell typed text from a placeholder

Written at 23:2x, correcting this seat's own confident rule from an hour earlier.

**The 21:59 case was real:** the prompt held `yes, start it now with subagents`, Ctrl-U cleared it, and
the pane visibly unblocked. That instance stands.

**The 23:2x case probably was not.** The prompt appeared to hold `check mail`; **Ctrl-U did NOT change
it** (identical before and after), yet `cockpit.sh say` reported *"prompt clear"* and delivered
successfully, and the agent immediately began working. The most likely reading is that ` check mail`
was **Claude Code's own placeholder/hint text, not typed input** — and a generic phrase like that is
exactly what a hint looks like.

**So: `tmux capture-pane` alone CANNOT distinguish typed input from placeholder text.** Do not build a
verdict on it.

**The safe procedure, in this order:**
1. **Try the tap first.** `cockpit.sh say … --mail …` refuses a genuinely occupied prompt and verifies
   delivery — it is a better instrument than reading the pane, and it is non-destructive.
2. **Only if the tap is REFUSED** is the prompt genuinely occupied. Then consider clearing.
3. **Never Ctrl-U on a pane reading alone**, and never on text that could be someone's real input
   without saying so afterwards to whoever might have typed it.

The earlier entry below has the reasoning for clearing when it IS occupied; this caveat governs
*whether it is occupied at all*.

**CONFIRMED BY A THIRD CASE, 23:3x — the corrected procedure works and the old one would have been
wrong.** HPSM's prompt appeared to hold `good night` — which is **Kam's own wrap-trigger phrase**, so
under the old rule this seat would have faced either enacting a session-end it could not attribute, or
destroying what might have been his typing. Instead the tap was tried first: it **delivered, "prompt
clear"**, proving the text was a placeholder and the prompt was never occupied. Nothing was enacted and
nothing was destroyed.

**Three cases now: one genuinely occupied (`yes, start it now with subagents`, 21:59, Ctrl-U cleared
it and the pane unblocked) and two placeholders (`check mail`, `good night`).** The tap is the
instrument; the pane reading is not.

## 🛏 HPSM WRAPPED AND ITS PANE IS CLOSED (2026-09-16 23:4x) — asked first, closed only on its own confirmation

HPSM finished everything assigned: pause banner and `:441`, clarification file (57 entries,
every quote script-checked), the no-fail audit, the VM recovery, and the rebuild plan with its four
questions — all committed, handover at `5_Project_History/HANDOVER-S48.md`, `79bc33c`. It then sat
idle, which made `wake_watch` fire correctly every ~3 minutes all night for an agent with nothing to do.

**It was asked to complete any outstanding wrap and EXIT, rather than having its pane killed from
here.** The pane read was ambiguous about whether anything was still in flight — and a grep meant to
settle that is exactly the kind whose count this seat's own hook warns about. **The agent knows
whether it has finished; this seat does not.** That is Kam's SME rule applied to the one decision where
getting it wrong truncates work.

**CLOSED at 23:4x, and only after it confirmed for itself.** It wrapped and mailed
`[Datasec/HPSM -> Tuesday] Session wrap 2026-09-16` (13:42:50Z) but did not exit the process, so the
pane kept firing a correct idle wake every ~3 minutes. Its own wrap mail, with **no "unfinished" mail
after it**, is the confirmation this seat lacked twenty minutes earlier — so `tmux kill-pane -t %7`
was then safe rather than a guess.

**The sequence is the point, and it is reusable: ask the agent → wait for ITS confirmation → act.**
Twenty minutes apart, the same action went from unsafe to obviously fine, and nothing changed except
that the agent said so. Its content survives in the wrap mail, `HANDOVER-S48.md` and its commits;
nothing was in the pane alone.

**To restart it:** `bash 2_Project_Files/fleet/cockpit/cockpit.sh launch Datasec/HPSM`.

## 🔕 USE `wake_ack.sh` FOR A BY-DESIGN HOLD — do not absorb the wake, and do not ignore it either

`bash 2_Project_Files/fleet/cockpit/wake_ack.sh %pane` (also `--list`, `--clear %pane`). Landed with
Wednesday's fix; the wake text now names it.

**It acks at a CONTENT HASH**, so it suppresses exactly the state you looked at and **re-fires the
moment that pane's output changes.** That is the important property: it silences a known hold without
disabling the signal — the opposite of the "absorb these wakes" instruction this seat had to withdraw
earlier tonight.

**Used 2026-09-17 00:0x on `%6`** (NexusAI holding while its own suite ran on the combined branch —
`1 shell still running`, and it had already said it would report when the suite finished). Acked at
hash `98122d5fb0ae`.

**The test for using it: is the agent waiting on ITSELF (a suite, a builder, a background shell), or
waiting on YOU?** Ack the first. Answer the second. Check its inbox before deciding, as the wake text
now tells you to.

*(`--list` currently shows stale entries for panes that no longer exist, e.g. `%7` after HPSM closed.
Harmless.)*

## ✅ FALSE WAKE FIXED at origin `d59cea765` — the signal is TRUSTWORTHY again, do not keep ignoring it

`monitor.sh` reads **"waiting on background subagents" as idle** and wakes the coordinator with
*"likely waiting on Wednesday — check the pane now"*. It fired **three times tonight** on
`Datasec/HPSM` while that agent was running four subagents. An agent whose work is in subagents has an
empty prompt and unchanging pane text — **which is what a productive agent looks like from outside.**

**CLAIMED BY WEDNESDAY, fix in progress (her mail 2026-09-16T12:58:24Z) — do not patch it from here.**
She corrected the diagnosis: **the wake text comes from `fleet/cockpit/wake_watch.sh`'s idle-at-prompt
leg, NOT `monitor.sh`** — this seat named the wrong file from the wake's wording. Her own seat hit a
sibling four times tonight on Secuura/Blockchain: the frozen-busy leg matches the `· 1 monitor` footer
over a frozen screen. Both legs are being fixed with arms built from real pane captures, and
`monitor.sh` is being checked for the same predicate in the same commit. **She mails the hash; this
seat picks it up at its next pull and needs no restart** (the runner re-arms every ~2 min).

**LANDED AND VERIFIED ON THIS TREE, 2026-09-16 23:2x** — not taken from the hash: `d59cea765` is an
ancestor of HEAD, `wake_watch.sh` carries `WAKE_WATCH_SUBAGENT_WAIT_MIN`, its predicate names the exact
`✻ Waiting for N background agents to finish` shape, and the runner is live and re-arms every ~2 min,
so no restart was needed.

⚠ **THE "ABSORB THESE WAKES" INSTRUCTION IS NOW WITHDRAWN. Treat an idle-at-prompt wake as REAL
again.** A bound of 60 minutes preserves the genuinely-stuck case, which is the half worth keeping —
HPSM sat stuck for an hour tonight and that mattered. **An instruction to ignore a signal is far more
dangerous once the signal is fixed than the false wakes ever were**, which is why this was rewritten
the moment the fix landed rather than left to decay.

Wednesday also corrected her own first hash: `15930f3af` never reached origin — that push was refused
because a panel_sync commit was ahead, and the mail went out from the same command without the refusal
being read. Same family as *never end a turn on "launched"*.

**The second-order risk is the one to care about: a detector that cries wolf gets ignored, and this is
the same wake that would report a genuinely stuck agent.** Tonight HPSM *was* stuck for an hour behind
a typed-unsent line, and that mattered. Reported to Wednesday with the evidence and a suggested
discriminator; **her file, not this seat's to patch.**

## ✅ MERGED: `b0ec4c2` → main as **`d6fe307`** (2026-09-17 00:5x)

Pushed with an explicit refspec (`a173dfd..d6fe307`), `ls-remote` returns
`d6fe307c91e9eed5f119efebdad1fdce7731bb98`, verify on the **merged tree** PASS 3094/3094 across 169
suites. **`CI_DEPLOY_ENABLED` re-checked immediately before the push** — repo and org endpoints both
200 with 0 entries — so `deploy-demo` cannot fire. CI on `d6fe307` running with a watcher.

**The framing correction reached the RECORD, not just the conversation:** RD-474 (comment 37617, now
labelled blocker), the re-gate report, **and the `d6fe307` merge commit message** all carry *"trades a
permanent lockout for a possible takeover of an unconfigured deployment"*. That is the difference
between a correction received and one that travelled — a commit message is what someone reads in six
months when the mail is gone.

**HISTORY.md entry on main: GO given** (docs-only, path-ignored by deploy-demo). Told not to leave it
for the next seat: **a gap in the record of a night's work reads as "nothing happened" later.**

**Then: CI conclusion → session wrap → stop.** `HANDOVER-S62.md` is its rotation boundary.

**Waiting on Kam from NexusAI alone:** RD-460, RD-464, RD-465, RD-470, RD-471, RD-472, RD-473, RD-474
and the certification paper — and its wrap will name them so he does not assemble that list at 6am.
**RD-474 blocks any resubmission.**

## ✅ RE-GATE PASSED (GO WITH FINDINGS, no Blockers) — merge APPROVED; one new card blocks resubmission

`b0ec4c2`: B-1, B-2 (M1–M6), F-1, F-2, F-3/F-8 and F-5 all FIXED and measured against `8246ee0`, suite
**PASS 3094/3094 on a clean clone.** Merge to main approved by this seat (publishes nothing; the
Partner Center upload stays Kam's and manual). Recipe required: fresh detached worktree at
`origin/main a173dfd`, `--no-ff`, **verify on the merged tree** (main is not an ancestor), re-check
`CI_DEPLOY_ENABLED` unset immediately before pushing, explicit refspec, `ls-remote`, CI.

### 🔴 NEW CARD: `nexusai-setup-mode-stranger-takeover` (RD-474) — the only non-registry resubmission blocker

The gate measured what an anonymous visitor can DO in Kam's intended open window, and it is more than
look: **save THEIR OWN Entra tenant and group — which enforces sign-in through THEIR IdP and locks the
real owner out** — plus export the config ZIP and start an erasure request.

**THE COMPARISON, and it is easy to state backwards:** live 2.1.1 = the same two requests cause a
**permanent lockout**, nothing taken, the stranger gains nothing. Candidate = **the owner can lose the
deployment to someone else.** **Recoverability improved; the worst case got worse.** A trade between
denial of service and takeover, not a strict improvement.

⚠ **A FRAMING CORRECTION WAS ISSUED AND MUST NOT BE LOST:** NexusAI wrote *"strictly more
recoverable"*. It is not. Earlier tonight the lockout-vs-takeover distinction was the stated reason Kam
was not woken — **RD-474 is the takeover.** Always describe it as *"trades a permanent lockout for a
possible takeover of an unconfigured deployment."*

Recommended option **(b) one-time setup token** from the deployment output: keeps the open window for
READING while making IdP configuration something only the deployer can do. (a) accepts a takeover path
on a paid product; (c) matches Kam's literal words but re-introduces a lockout at first-run completion.

### Filed, not blocking
**RD-471 (High) is B-2's class, THIRD instance:** a DropDown/OptionsGroup makes `defaultValue` a
**label** while the output is the item **value**, so the check records a false PASS. It cannot bite
while no release registry is named — **so it must be fixed BEFORE Kam names one**, because naming one
is the moment that check starts being trusted. Also RD-472 (nested deployments, jobs, case-variant
keys) and RD-473 (UI-saved Entra values silently ignored when `AZURE_AD_*` env is set — matters because
the new guide advertises the env route).

## 🔵 RE-GATE RUNNING on `b0ec4c2` (GO given 2026-09-17 00:1x) — verdict is the next thing owed

Rework pushed, combined head verifies **PASS 3094/3094 across 169 suites**. Nothing merged.

- **RD-462 (`53ad418`)**: one resolver behind sign-in, group check, enforce, `getEntraIdConfig` and the
  self-heal; `adminGateRefuses` in setup mode until sign-in exists. **12/17 cells red on `8246ee0`.**
  B-1 and F-1 closed, F-2 back to ENFORCED.
- **RD-463 (`b0ec4c2`)**: outputs resolved the way ARM does, every container image and registry server
  checked, empty/incomplete listings fail. **18/30 cells red on the old script including all of M1–M6**,
  30/30 green now, M1–M6 kept as permanent cells. **Real 2.1.1 package: exit 1, 37 checks, 6 failed —
  and the manifest now NAMES WHERE THE IMAGE VALUE CAME FROM**, which is the actual repair of F-3: the
  old one recorded a value with no provenance, so nothing could act on it.

**A principle worth reusing, from how it wrote up its own blind spots (C-40):** *computed outputs
(`concat`/`if`) must resolve to **FAIL, never PASS**.* **When a check cannot determine a value, it fails
closed.** That is the general answer to everything tonight was about — a check that cannot tell should
say so loudly, not quietly return green. Apply it to any gate, any guard, any verifier: **the
undetermined case belongs with the failures, not the passes.**

**Three behaviours to hold agents to, all from this rework:**
1. **It named what its own fix still cannot see** — dotted section paths, concat/if outputs, second
   apps, initContainers. Told to carry those as **known limits** in the certification paper, not a
   to-do list. A fix that ships with its blind spots written down can be reasoned about.
2. **It re-ran the new check against the REAL shipped package**, not a fixture.
3. **It did not force-push to tidy a number.** The commit message quotes the builder branch's
   3086/3086 while the combined head measures 3094/3094; it stated the discrepancy and left history
   alone. **Never rewrite a record to make a number look tidy** — a commit message made consistent
   after the fact stops being evidence.

**After the verdict:** PASS → it reports, **this seat rules on the merge; it does not merge on a pass
alone.** Any Blocker → stop, report, rework (that loop cost ~1h tonight and caught two real defects).
Then it **stops for the night**; RD-464/RD-465 wait for Kam.

**Main `a173dfd` CI:** Gitleaks success, npm-audit success, deploy-demo skipped (both jobs), Build was
on its test step at 14:04Z (~55-min run) — conclusion still owed.

## 🟢 REWORK: B-1 and F-1 CLOSED, proven red-first (2026-09-16 23:4x). RD-463 still with a builder.

**RD-462 rework done and proven.** One resolver `resolveEntraConfig` (env `AZURE_AD_*` first, then
settings) now used by the self-heal, `getMsalConfig`, the callback group check, `POST /api/auth/enforce`
and `getEntraIdConfig` — the five sites that disagreed. `adminGateRefuses` replaces 8 inline gates and
deliberately does **not** refuse while no sign-in is configured, which is Kam's "open until the admin
sets Entra" preserved rather than quietly fixed away.

**Red first, as required: 12 of 17 cells fail on `8246ee0`**, green after, 134/134 across the auth
suites, **with the env-only and mixed-config regression cells in.** End to end both directions:
env-configured + the two POSTs → `authEnforced true`, anonymous 401 (**B-1 closed**); no IdP + the two
POSTs → open, anonymous `POST /api/auth/entra-config` 200, state immediately enforced, anonymous 401
(**F-1 closed — the site is securable from inside**).

⚠ **CARRY THIS TO KAM: the DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE now has an F-8 upgrade note — "a 2.1.1 lockout OPENS on
upgrade; finish User Access at once."** So a customer upgrading off the live 2.1.1 has their lockout
released, and the open window reopens with it. Good news and a new sharp edge in the same sentence.

**Honestly parked rather than silently skipped:** the settings view near `server.js:13968` reads
settings-first, plus Graph provisioning and health. Not sign-in decisions; being ticketed as follow-up.

**Main CI on `a173dfd`: Gitleaks success, npm-audit success, Deploy demo SKIPPED — exactly as NexusAI
predicted before pushing.** Build still running.

**HPSM's session wrap arrived 13:42:50Z.** It is done for the night.

## 🔴 GATE VERDICT: **NO GO** on candidate `8246ee0` — two Blockers in work this seat authorised

**Not merged.** `main` is unaffected and holds 1470e18 via **`a173dfd`** (verify PASS 3017/3017 across
164 suites, `ls-remote` read back). Rework **authorised** and running.

**B-2 IS THE FINDING OF THE NIGHT, and it is the lesson recursing.** The new build check — the fix for
F-3, the check that recorded and never asserted — **reads the wizard element's `defaultValue`, not the
image the package actually deploys.** Six mutations that ship the forbidden dev image built with
**exit 0**, each printing a false `[PASS] default image = <release image>`. And it passed its own tests
because **the fixture had `outputs:{}` and `resources:[]`** — nothing for the check to get wrong.

**So the rule needs its sharper form, and it is the one to carry forward:** it is not enough to ask
*"can this check fail"*. Ask **"can it fail on the thing it claims to be about"**. A check that asserts
confidently about the WRONG value is worse than no check, because it manufactures evidence. **An empty
fixture is a red control that can only ever be green.**

**B-1: the RD-462 lockout fix would have OPENED a correctly-secured site.** The self-heal read settings
only, while `getMsalConfig` and the group check read the ENVIRONMENT first — **and the README documents
that env route to customers.** Env-configured deployments would go ENFORCED → OPEN, and the enforce
route could never secure them. Fix: one shared resolver (env first, then settings) across the
self-heal, the enforce route and `getEntraIdConfig`, **with regression cells for env-only and mixed
configs — that half must not be dropped.**

**Unasked-for and right:** before pushing the merge, NexusAI verified `deploy-demo.yml` could not fire
(`vars.CI_DEPLOY_ENABLED` unset at repo AND org level, both endpoints 200 with 0 variables, last 6 main
pushes skipped). **A merge is only safe if you know what it triggers.** CI on `a173dfd` still running.

## ✅ NEXUSAI RELEASE CANDIDATE — gate commissioned, main merge authorised (2026-09-16 23:1x)

`mkt-rc-selfcontained-s62 @ 8246ee0`, pushed, suite 3069/3069 across 169 suites. Carries: the hygiene
merge, RD-461 (no publisher inboxes/signature/tooltip), RD-453 (arm-ttk 32/32), **RD-462 = the F-1
lockout fix** (red first: 6/9 failing unpatched, green on the fix, lockout reproduced and cleared end
to end on a local server, recovery documented), and **RD-463 = the F-3 build-script fix.**

**The F-3 control is the thing to remember from tonight:** the NEW build check run against the package
that actually shipped **exits 1 with 29 checks and 4 failed** — tag 2.1.0 ≠ 2.1.1, no policy at that
commit, no release registry, and **a live anonymous pull returning HTTP 401.** The OLD script on the
same commit exits 141 with a truncated manifest. So it is not "the fix works", it is **"the fix would
have caught this"**, with the control that makes the claim mean something. Including a live pull in a
build check tests the property a customer depends on rather than our belief about the registry.

**AUTHORISED by this seat under protocol v1.3** (merges sit with the coordinator; production, money,
external comms and irreversible actions stay Kam's): merge `1470e18 → main`. It publishes nothing —
the Partner Center upload is a separate manual act and is Kam's. **The candidate merge waits for its
own gate verdict; the two are not chained.**

**Correction given, and worth repeating to any agent:** NexusAI wrote *"I'm treating that merge as
covered unless you say otherwise."* Told not to — **an assumption presented as covered is the exact
shape that put a dev registry into a live listing.** Ask; the answer is one line.

**Still flagged UNPROVEN in everything Kam reads:** the apiVersions. Preflight cannot see them (the
2099 control passed), so his Marketplace preview test is their first real exercise.

## 📌 OWNED BY THIS SEAT, DEADLINE 24 SEPTEMBER — download the published Marketplace packages

**Partner Center stops serving previously published packages after 2026-09-24.** NexusAI has local
copies in `evidence-s62-published-packages/`, but the PUBLISHED ones can only be fetched through
Partner Center — **which this seat can reach and no agent can.** Chrome on this machine is signed into
an account with access, and *Allow JavaScript from Apple Events* is ON (Kam enabled it 2026-09-16), so
the offer and its plan pages are readable from here.

**Route:** offer `c8c0cb53-f392-4340-9fd8-204ca38cb25f` → plan `57be7273-1e64-40e0-a486-443d11e7ff11`
→ Technical configuration → *Previously published packages*.

**Deliberately NOT done overnight**, and the reasoning should survive: eight days of margin, browser
automation against a live publishing console is a poor trade unattended, and if any step needs Kam's
click it is better to ask once while he is awake. **Do it in daylight — and do not let the margin
erode into an emergency; it is a task with a date, not a someday.** NexusAI has been told explicitly
not to spend context on it.

## ⚠ SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE ON IRREPLACEABLE EVIDENCE — raise with Kam, cheap now, impossible later

From HPSM's rebuild plan (`qa-s48/2026-09-16_toolkit-rebuild-plan-FOR-KAM.md`, commit `79bc33c`):
**the pc-lane-a backup is also gone, so the Azure VM backup is the ONLY 2026-09-14 recovery point.**

Two things follow, and neither is urgent tonight but both get worse with time:

1. **Do not let anyone clean up that VM.** It is no longer a dev box, it is the sole surviving copy of
   a recovery point. Kam should know that before anyone tidies Azure.
2. **The recovered archive lives in HPSM's LOCAL-ONLY analysis repo** (`qa-s48/vm-recovery/`) — HPSM
   has stated that repo has no remote until HPSM-40. So the recovered evidence currently exists on the
   VM and on this drive, **and nowhere with a remote.** Two copies, one of them a machine someone
   might reasonably delete.

**Also from the plan, and it is the honest part:** the upgrade half can be *reconstructed* from the
TKF report's file:line spec, but **never proven byte-identical — no post-TKF hash was ever recorded.**
The D-S47-89 fix and p2b.sh would be re-creations from prose and **are not evidence.** Its
recommendation is to treat any rebuild as a NEW revision with its manifest archived. That is right.

**One operational trap recorded there: `walk-fresh` must NOT be re-run — it creates engagements.**
Confirm the existing A2/B2 instead. And every rerun needs the P1-P3 fixes first, or it reproduces the
blind spots it is meant to test.

**Fix order when Kam rules: P1 is V6**, because it manufactures a false PASS and writes it into the
evidence, and it is present in the recovered live copy.

## 🟠 HPSM: the Azure purge IS re-verified; only the upgrade half stays unverifiable (card AMENDED)

Card `hpsm-live-release-verification-unprovable`. **This is a claim about our EVIDENCE, not about the
product — keep them apart in anything written to Kam.** The hardened toolkit that produced the live
release's 115/0, 21/0 and 11/0 results lived only in a `/private/tmp` session scratchpad and is
**gone**. The only surviving copy predates the hardening and **passes while its probes fail**: a failed
bucket listing reads as an empty bucket *and the backup then records every object as the empty-input
hash*; empty API output with rc 0 reads PASS and 26 checks vanish; a manifest hash mismatch still
reports PASS.

**Correct wording: the release is UNVERIFIED, not unsafe.** Nothing suggests the product is wrong.

**RECOVERY DONE, PARTIAL SUCCESS (2026-09-16 23:0x).** The Azure VM's `~/purge-s47-live` held the
**purge half** of the post-TKF toolkit: 90/90 files matching hashes taken on the VM, TKF markers
present, so provably the hardened version that ran live. Archived at HPSM `qa-s48/vm-recovery/`.

**The Azure purge 115/0 was re-examined against it and the pass is SUPPORTED** — the four checks that
*can* silently pass did not fire on that data: bucket listing really worked (7 keys → 1, backup hashed
7 real objects, zero empty-input hashes), V5 had real output (39 PASS / 0 FAIL), all 15 purged
engagements 404 while the kept one answered 200, approvals 0 decisions over 2 exceptions. **One real
gap inside it: the auditor audit-events read was INFO-only (3 × 404), so that step did not verify.**

**Still unverifiable and genuinely lost** (that half ran from the Mac through a tunnel): both stacks'
upgrade verification — postcheck 21/0, kept-stale 11/0, walk-fresh A2/B2, the browser gate, the 28
probes — and the pc-lane-a purge 115/0. **Unverified, not shown unsafe.** Kam's call, can wait.
**The toolkit is rebuilt before any NEXT live run regardless.**

**Card AMENDED with the reason recorded** — the original wording would have had him wake to a worse
picture than reality.

**Nothing is being fixed** — HPSM held correctly. V6 is the one to fix first when Kam rules: it does not
merely fail to detect, it **manufactures a false success and writes it into the evidence.**

Quality note worth keeping: every finding in that audit carries a red control that was actually run,
and HPSM sent an unprompted correction when one figure turned out to have come from prose rather than
measurement (18 of 27, not 16).

## 🔴 TWO FINDINGS FOR KAM, both carded/boarded 2026-09-16 ~23:45. Neither woke him; reasons recorded.

### F-1 — an anonymous stranger can permanently lock the owner out. **Pre-existing, so LIVE in 2.1.1.**
On a freshly deployed instance that has not finished setup, anyone who can reach the hostname sends
two requests — create an admin user, then mark first-run complete — and afterwards auth is
**"enforced" while no identity provider can sign anyone in**: local login 401, Entra unconfigured,
admin-reset unusable because the template never sets `ADMIN_RESET_KEY`. Survives restart. **Only
recovery is hand-editing settings on the customer's Azure Files share, and nothing shipped says so.**
Measured by the gate 3× on the release head, 1× on `main`.

**Why he was not woken** — state these if challenged, and re-test them if anything changes: no
customers on the listing *by his own word*; a deployment still needs a token we hand over, so the
exposed population is one we control; and the harm is **denial of service to the owner, not
disclosure**. NexusAI is told to report immediately if it finds a deployment that is neither ours nor
accounted for — **that would change the answer.**

**Fix AUTHORISED and running in the candidate** (not a signature class), with the regression test
required to go **RED on today's code first** — a test written against a fix proves the fix compiles,
not that the bug existed. Documenting the recovery path is part of it.
**Card for him: `nexusai-live-listing-lockout-warn-now`** — only the part that is his, whether the
LIVE listing needs a warning before the fixed package lands. Recommended: no change.

### F-3 — the check that has never once run. **This is the night's real finding.**
`session-tools/marketplace-package-build.sh` **exits 141 on EVERY build** (SIGPIPE inside a pipefail
pipe, line 98). **Both submitted MANIFESTs are truncated.** A build with a nonexistent tag, the wrong
registry or a missing element is **indistinguishable from a good one**.

So the dev-registry default did not slip past a check — **it slipped past a check that never completed**,
which is exactly why the manifest recorded `wizard default containerImage = nexusaidevacrfa39…` and
nothing acted on it.

**Three instances tonight, three places:** a manifest that records and never asserts; a preflight that
passes `apiVersion 2099-01-01`; a build script that reports success by exiting 141. NexusAI is told to
make this the **headline** of the certification paper. **The resubmission question is not "is this
package right" but "what would have told us if it weren't".**

### RD-461 — CLOSED, theoretical, on real evidence
697 ticks at `sent=0`, 18 start lines all DRAFT, live mode gated on env vars that are not set, 0
references in the submitted template. A negative proved rather than assumed. Fix stays in the
candidate; its side effect (288 false ERRORs/day polluting the demo's failure signal) is worth fixing
on its own merits.

## 🔴 FIRST THING FOR KAM: "anyone who pays" is impossible on the CURRENT offer type

Card `nexusai-monetisation-model-and-public-registry` is open and is the first thing to put in front
of him. **NexusAI measured that Microsoft does not let a Solution template charge anything, and a
Solution template is what is live.** So his requirement *"anyone who pays can deploy"* cannot happen on
the published offer: today it means *anyone with an Azure subscription*, and a public image removes a
key rather than widening access. Real pay-to-deploy = a different offer model (Container offer on AKS,
SaaS, VM) = re-architecture. A Managed application can only charge a management fee.

**Recommendation on the card (theirs and this seat's):** a new dedicated Standard ACR, anonymous pull,
release images only, digest-pinned, the four credential fields deleted from the wizard. **~US$20/month
= money = his signature class. The push is his too.** Full paper: NexusAI
`5_Project_History/2026-09-16_self-contained-package-options.md`, RD-460.

**Two certification facts found, unresolved, both READ-ONLY until he says otherwise:** Microsoft Learn
says containers are **not supported** for Solution templates — yet 2.1.1 certified; and policy 300.4.7
requires all deployment artifacts in the zip. NexusAI is establishing which is true and drafting, NOT
sending, a question to Partner Center support — **contacting them is external comms and Kam's.**

**Proceeding without him:** the three other non-self-contained items (RD-451 demo probe, mail-triage
default Datasec inboxes, "unless Datasec advises" tooltips — defects against a requirement already
given), the tier-1 gate on 1470e18, and the rest of the fix order. **Do not create the registry "ready
for approval" — creating it IS the spend.**

**⏳ 24 September: Partner Center stops serving previously published packages.** Eight days. Downloading
old packages as evidence needs no permission and cannot be undone later.

## ✅ RESOLVED 23:2x — the typed-unsent line at HPSM's prompt (pane %7)

`yes, start it now with subagents` — typed, never sent. **Not enacted by this seat and it must not
be.** It cannot be attributed: possibly Kam with a swallowed Enter, possibly Claude Code's own
suggested text. Pane text is not a channel of record in either direction
(learnings: ghost text / pane prompts contain Claude's own suggestions).

**How it was resolved, and the reasoning is the reusable part.** It sat for over an hour with HPSM
idle, and it also blocked tapping — `cockpit.sh say` REFUSES an occupied prompt, so the pane could be
MAILED but not WOKEN. The line was **CLEARED (Ctrl-U), never sent**, and the pane then tapped at the
mail. So nothing unattributable was enacted, and the instruction HPSM acted on is the mailed one with
provenance. Kam was told, since the typing may have been his.

**The rule for next time:** an occupied prompt is a *stuck agent*, not just untidiness — it silently
disables the wake channel. Clear it and point at mail; never press Enter on text you cannot attribute,
and never discard it silently either — say that you did, to whoever might have typed it.

## 🌙 OVERNIGHT POSTURE — Kam signed off ~22:50 with *"good luck with getting the project submission ready"*

He has handed the resubmission to this seat. **That is permission to keep working, not permission to
widen.** Read the two lines below before anything else.

**WHAT PROCEEDS WITHOUT HIM.** Everything up to, but not including, his signature classes: the tier-1
gate and its verdict; NexusAI's fix order; the options-and-recommendation work on the self-contained
requirement; package changes in a NEW candidate; HPSM's remaining `:441` edit; both clarification
files. Usage is not a constraint — this account's cut is 95 and we are at ~70.

**WHAT STOPS AND WAITS, no matter how ready it looks.** A registry **push** (his own 09-12 ruling:
the registry is one HE names and the push is his signature class); any **resubmission** to Partner
Center; production; money; external comms; anything irreversible. **The self-contained fix cannot be
finished without him** — it ends at "here are the options, here is the recommendation". Do not let a
good night's work talk itself into the last step.

**THE REQUIREMENT THAT NOW GOVERNS THE WHOLE PACKAGE** (Kam, ~22:40, verbatim): *"the zip needs to be
self contained.  we will not give people access to the repo or keys.  the intended model is that
anyone who pays can deploy."* So `acrUsername`/`acrPassword` are **defects, not configuration**, and
the test applies to the WHOLE package — repo URLs, keys, manual steps, documents only we hold.

**HOW TO WORK, because he corrected this seat on it tonight** (~22:40): *"each project agent is very
capable and should load with the project files … work with them as Subject matter experts. Checking
yourself is great but you should not do what they should."* **Ask the agent, verify the answer, carry
it. Do not go and measure inside their project yourself** — this seat did exactly that with the
marketplace zip and got a worse answer than the agent did, then had to correct Kam.

## LIVE STATE at 2026-09-16 22:2x — both agents delivered; here is what is open

**HPSM (pane %7)** — ALL ASSIGNED WORK DONE. The `:441` edit landed at `543dc4e`
(*"flag to Tuesday/Kam BEFORE creating"*), with `:442` kept as history exactly as ruled, and counts
carrying a negative control (`Wednesday/Kam` = 0). It is now seeding its clarification file with
subagents, bounded, and will send the path and entry count when it stops. **Nothing is owed to it by
this seat.** Its own backlog — 26 open Jira tickets, none touched in 3 days — is folded into its next
plan, not tonight's work.

Earlier the same session, also done and verified: pause banner removed with the subagent standing rule kept,
both `wednesday-agent@` lines fixed, both routing tags accepted, commit `fa73832`. It caught two of
this seat's errors (line 219 was 220; the addendum asserted a fact about ITS launcher taken from a
file in OUR tree). **Owes:** the `:441` edit (Wednesday→Tuesday on the live billing-flag line; `:442`
stays as history) and its hash. Rule given for its clarification file: **change instructions, preserve
history.**

**NexusAI (pane %6)** — DONE: RD-399 unpaused, `CLARIFICATIONS.md` created with 37 entries and wired
into its boot (RD-459), and it answered **"not blocked"** on the HPSM merge-queue note while correctly
declining to assert HPSM's queue state, which is outside its scope. **GO given** on the tier-1 gate for
`mkt-round4-onto-main-s60 @ 1470e18`. **Owes:** that gate's verdict and Kam's review of what remains.

**The gate item added, and it is the lesson of the whole evening:** the 09-15 build manifest RECORDED
`wizard default containerImage = nexusaidevacrfa39...` at build time. The defect that made the offer
undeployable was in our own evidence and shipped anyway. **A fact written into evidence that nothing
asserts on is not a check.** Also flagged: the 2.1.1 package ships a 2.1.0 image tag, and nothing
checks that either.

**KAM SUBMITTED 2.1.1** (his words to NexusAI, their C-24). That package was already among the ten
checked — it points at the same closed dev registry. **So the answer is confirmed against the real
submission, not inferred, and Partner Center is no longer needed for it.**

**PENDING KAM:** (1) the registry name — still the only blocker on a correct package; (2) Azure
device-code login `P66F33WMH` as `kreiser.org@me.com`, still waiting, for the customer-path deploy;
(3) Chrome's *Allow JavaScript from Apple Events* still reports OFF, so page content is unreadable
from this seat; Screen Recording needs a restart and he cannot do it yet.

## 🔴 NEXUSAI — MEASURED: the submitted offer CANNOT be deployed by a customer

**Answered, do not re-derive.** `marketplace-submission-2026-09-15/NexusAI_plan-managed-ai_2.1.0_8f50eeb.zip`
defaults every customer to `nexusaidevacrfa39.azurecr.io/nexusai:2.1.0` (tooltip: "leave the default").
That registry **refuses anonymous clients**: an `oauth2/token` request scoped `repository:nexusai:pull`
with no credentials returns `UNAUTHORIZED — authentication required`. **Positive control:** the same
method against `mcr.microsoft.com` returns HTTP 200. So the deployment dies at image pull in any
customer tenant. **Kam's customer-path test tomorrow will fail at exactly that point** — now a
confirmation, not a discovery.

**Two of this seat's own earlier claims were WRONG and are corrected:** the "May 2.0.0 build with none
of rounds 2-4" is out of date (the package ships 2.1.0 at its own commit), and
`myregistry.azurecr.io/nexusai:1.3.0` in mainTemplate is an EXAMPLE inside a `metadata.description`,
not a defect. **The content was fine; the packaging was not.**

**CONFIRMED ACROSS ALL TEN PACKAGES (2026-09-16 22:0x), not just the submitted one:** every NexusAI
plan zip on this drive — every commit, 2.0.0 through 2.1.1 — defaults the wizard to
`nexusaidevacrfa39.azurecr.io`. Not one points elsewhere. **A third party cannot deploy any of them.**
No self-service workaround: a customer can retype the image field but has no access to the registry
and no copy of the image. **Limit on the claim, stated to Kam:** Partner Center is unreadable from
this seat, so the LIVE listing was not read — the answer only changes if the listing carries a package
absent from this drive, and the 09-15 manifest (which records the dev default at build time and says
nothing had been uploaded) makes that unlikely. **Asked Kam for Partner Center access to close that
gap properly rather than by inference.**

**PROCESS FINDING for the resubmission:** the build manifest RECORDED `wizard default containerImage =
nexusaidevacrfa39...` at build time. It was visible in our own evidence and shipped anyway — a gate we
did not have. It belongs in the pre-submission checks.

**THE ONE BLOCKER, with Kam:** which registry a customer pulls from. His 09-12 ruling makes it his to
name and the push his signature class; he has never named it. **Nothing becomes client-ready until he does.**

**MANDATE WIDENED (Kam ~21:50):** *"review the whole project and fix everything that needs fixing to
make the product as good as possible"*; a second submission only *"when it is 100% ready"*. This
SUPERSEDES the earlier "review and STOP". Bar given to the agent: **would a customer who has never met
us succeed, unaided, from the listing alone.** Told NOT to submit and NOT to modify the submitted
package — Kam deploys that exact artefact tomorrow and it is evidence now.

**INTENDED, NOT A BUG (Kam ~21:58):** *"the deployed site should work until the client finishes setting
up the entra group to authenticate against. until then, anyone can access the site."* **Do not let any
agent gate, password or IP-restrict that window** — access policy is Kam's. NexusAI is measuring how
long it stays open, how guessable the hostname is, what is reachable while it is open, and whether the
UI and docs SAY so; reporting, not acting. If they find reachable customer data, an exposed key or a
pre-setup admin action, that stops and comes to Kam.

## STANDING, fleet-wide (Kam, 2026-09-16 ~22:00) — settled decisions get WRITTEN DOWN by the agent

*"the agent knows. get the agent to make these kinds of notes so its not something we keep coming back
to. Maybe an agent generated project definition / clarification file"* — said after this seat briefed
NexusAI on a fact it already held.

Both Datasec agents now carry it as a standing duty: an agent-written clarification file in their own
tree (`1_Project_Definition/CLARIFICATIONS.md` suggested, path theirs). **The coordinator does not
write or edit it** — it has to live in their tree to be read at their boot. Contents: intended-but-
looks-like-a-bug first, settled decisions including what was decided against, Kam's rulings with date
and words, deliberate limitations, and already-answered questions. Provenance on every entry;
supersede rather than delete; keep it pruned. Open questions stay tickets; no secrets.

**The coordinator half of this rule:** check what an agent already knows before briefing it, and when
a question surfaces a second time, get it written down rather than answering it again. Ask for the
file and the entry, not for the answer.

## USAGE — this seat has NO 40% cap; that was Wednesday's

Kam, 2026-09-16 21:3x: *"the 40% was only for wednesday and Secuura projects. you are on a different
account and do not have that constraint."* and *"the message was on the wednesday chat board not
yours."* `fleet/USAGE_STOP` (40) is hers. This seat reads `fleet/USAGE_STOP.tuesday` = **95**, on his 2026-09-16 21:40 instruction
*"bump yours to 95%"* (it was briefly 90, the fleet default, before he said so). **The seats are on separate
accounts; usage is never shared** — measured at the time: Wednesday 7%, Tuesday 70%.

## TOMORROW'S DATASEC PICTURE — assembled 2026-09-16 20:4x so it is not re-derived

Nothing is running on this machine: `tmux list-panes -a` = this seat and the fleet monitor, no agent
sessions. Nothing was launched tonight and that was deliberate — Kam's autostart grant
(2026-08-12) is for the **morning** sweep, and his 20:23 note said *"i will comment on this
tomorrow. we have new actions and work to do"*. Launching at 20:45 would have been scope nobody gave.

- **All Datasec projects are reachable** at `/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/!CODING/Datasec/` — ATTIO,
  Commercial Readiness, CypherKey, Feedback_System, HPAM, HPSM, Lead_Bot, Marketing_Collateral,
  myPKI, NexusAI, RESEARCH. DevMASTER is not mounted here and its absence is not a missing project.
- **HPSM is the live one and the only open Datasec card.** `hpsm-composer-monday-review-scope`
  is still `open`, and Kam said at 20:23 he comments on it tomorrow — **do not re-ask it, and do not
  rule it.** Its own default already records his 15:24:26 supersede: *"build the full website and
  fully functioning engine"*, read as the remaining MVP A build (architecture 6.1-6.3 — WP3 rules
  engine, WP4 API, WP5 web UI screens 1-10, WP6 manifest + renderers), each through its tier-1 gate,
  local-first, nothing HP-facing, no deploys; commissioned to HPSM session 39.
- **HPSM's newest history entry is session 47 (2026-09-14)**: the full release — Composer `main` at
  `7a477400f9b315f485b7257f5cb8bde78403943d`, 16 merges from `b9c6464`, both live stacks purged.
  Sessions 39 and 47 are both referenced; **reconcile which is current before briefing anyone.**
- NexusAI and HPAM have no `5_Project_History/history.md` on this drive — unmeasured rather than
  inactive. Check their boards before assuming either way.

**The morning grant applies at the next MORNING boot:** sweep Secuura/Blockchain · Datasec/NexusAI ·
Datasec/Vision read-only (skip myPKI, CypherKey, Lead_Bot), launch and brief where there are
agent-actionable tickets, no per-morning confirmation needed. Signature classes still pause for Kam.

## SCOPE — unchanged

Datasec only (Kam, 2026-09-09: *"you will work on ONLY datasec projects unless otherwise
instructed"*). Secuura and general belong to Wednesday on the Studio. Datasec projects live at
`/Volumes/KK_T9_External_HDD/!CODING/Datasec/` — DevMASTER is not mounted on this machine and its
absence is not a missing project. Cross-seat mail to Wednesday is **coordination only**: never
Datasec code, findings, tickets or credentials.
