# NEXT PICKUP (Mon 19 Oct, afternoon)

## 0. FIRST ACTIONS FOR THE NEXT WEDNESDAY SEAT
1. Boot reads as the launcher says. Then kam_rulings_today.sh (the WHOLE day), reconcile_rulings.py, `bash 2_Project_Files/tools/newmail.sh` (to a file), fleet_ack.sh list, decision_queue.sh list open, fleet/usage_gate.sh --check, `local-model/spark/tunnel.sh check`.
2. **In force:** Kam 10-18 "new account: tickets, backlog, routing definition, Spark as many as it can handle" (EXPIRING-GRANTS top row). Routing v1.0. Gauge 29% at 14:05. Kam last posted 11:08; all his cards ruled (only Tuesday's Composer card open).
3. Commit your own files by pathspec before any tool that pulls.

## 1. LIVE WORK (14:0x)
- **develop = 04a4a33938f05312a184fd2ca294745d628ff75d** (#1568 merged, tree 24cc02989cf1 verified by Wednesday's own fetch into scratch). 39 Secuura merges since 19:00 Sun. Nothing deployed.
- **Seat R 51st (%10, still "Opus 5", ctx ~50%, busy):** holds a GO for #1602, #1603, #1604, #1605 (gate Q1, verdict `0_Brain/reference/2026-10-19_gate-Q1-screen11-four/verdict.md`, re-hashed EQUAL both readings), one at a time, heads pinned, chained tree 34ea098a022c onto 04a4a339; #1603 ships AS IS (Wednesday's ruling). Its queue: those merges at a boundary → KS-1638 (tier 1) → the #1597 author force-push (ALLOW_FORCE=1) → KS-1622 → the SCREEN_12 four (NEXT mailed 14:0x). On its MERGED mail: ls-remote, fetch into scratch (`git clone --shared` + fetch in the session scratchpad), compare trees. **Switch it to Opus 5.5 at its first real idle** (raw `/model claude-opus-5-5`, then a model-note mail). Rotation of the R lane is due at its own band.
- **Seat J 13th (%6, Opus 5.5, ctx ~53%):** RULED (a): KS-1385 (b) issuer-field freeze (Kam's card ks1385 = b, "Holder may update, but not the issuer fields"), DESIGN MAIL FIRST, then build on Wednesday's ruling, then one tier-1 Opus gate. Rule the design on: every write path; where the freeze lives and its trigger-name order vs 050/051 (name order is observable, XT1/XT2 today); the holder-update cell; the refusal shape; cells that change; partition vs R's files.
- **Testing Agent MAIN clean-up session (%11, Opus 5.5):** Kam's card `wed-devmaster-drive-cleanup-1019` = b, QA-clone half. Brief `2_Project_Files/fleet/briefs_staged/2026-10-19_testing-agent-qa-scratch-cleanup.md` + ADDENDUM-1 (a clone and its same-report worktrees go as one unit; measured: all wt gitdirs point inside their own report folder). It has no inbox: its channel is that folder (Wednesday's tracked tree) + pointer taps. Census was 33/55 at 13:5x, nothing removed. Its report: `!CODING/Testing Agent MAIN/projects/secuura/CLEANUP-2026-10-19.md`. On its end: read the report, df, then `decision_queue.sh --delivered wed-devmaster-drive-cleanup-1019` (the model half is already done: CLEANUP_B) and tell Kam the GB. Then close the pane (`pane_close.sh`).
- **Spark:** SCREEN_12 done (`0_Brain/reference/2026-10-18_spark-screen/SCREEN_12.md`): 4 PASS HELD by Wednesday after reading the product hunks (READY_KS-1506-AUDITEXPORTAUTH-1, READY_KS-1539-INFOREADERLOGCLASS-1, READY_KS-1637-RETIREDVERIFYAPPCELL-1, READY_KS-1503-CONNECTORMOUNTHUNKS-1), queued to R. **KS-623 FAILED (model: `--- a/` header on a NEW file; content tree-identical): Wednesday's ONE rebrief is owed** (name the `--- /dev/null` rule at the top of `## Output`), brief `local-model/night/briefs/ks_623_p1/`. The KS-1634 v2 brief (`night/briefs/ks_1634_v2_p1/`) runs after #1597 merges. Pool 359 (SCREEN_12 funnel); next screen when R's batches merge. Card candidates in SCREEN_12 (KS-1633, KS-1630, KS-1635) unread by Wednesday.
- **Waiting on Kam's hands:** two rm commands for the oMLX Qwen folders (copies verified on G-DRIVE), on the panel since 12:3x. Gatesets: 161 eligible but git-TRACKED: needs a git rm plan with Kam.

## 1b. RULED BY WEDNESDAY TODAY, STILL OPERATIVE (Secuura)
- KS-1628 L1/L6 = (iii) → KS-1634. #1597: (iii) now, then (i); KS-1638 first; `ALLOW_FORCE=1` accepted, `--no-verify` refused.
- #1568 round 4 (b): test-only delta, gated (R1), merged. #1603 ships as is (provider status in the 400 body; the pre-existing token-endpoint body echo goes on KS-1617 as its own question).
- KS-1377 residue as the gate measured (revoke only; last_used_at backwards). No Docker on the Studio for any seat.
- KS-805 Closes; KS-1471 Closes; KS-1544 Refs; KS-1525 Refs; KS-1622's widened scope = R's Claude build.

## 2. KAM'S CARDS
To deliver: `secuura-datasec-author-on-two-branch-commits-1019` (after the #1597 force-push), `wed-devmaster-drive-cleanup-1019` (after the %11 report). Delivered today: `secuura-ks1612-round3-nogo-1019`, `wed-secuura-storage-27-held-worktrees-1019`.

## 3. OWED BY WEDNESDAY (own tools, small)
1. cockpit.sh say --mail: stamp the mail's timestamp into the pointer; `say %4` (pane id) is a silent no-op: fail loudly.
2. pretooluse_no_cd.sh: allow a variable path that resolves inside WEDNESDAY or the session scratchpad.
3. Deploy round (Kintsugi): READ-ONLY census seat first, once tasks/DEPLOY-BLOCKERS.md clears.
4. Fable 5.1 coordinator-task trial (routing decision 7).
5. The 95 `t <t@e.com>`-authored commits on develop: check whether they are tracked.
6. Keep stash@{0} and older stashes; never drop them.
7. Gate brief template: name every touched service's suites as RUN or NOT-tested-by-name (P1 missed anchoring's integration suite today; ledger row).
