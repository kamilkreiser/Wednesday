# NEXT PICKUP — Thu 5 Nov 2026, 07:14 (the 06:00 morning seat)

## KAM TODAY (live board, view=wednesday, read with kam_msgs.sh; all three RULED in the store, HTTP 200)
- 07:07:25 "Decision wed-morning-fleet-activity-1105: a — Plan stands" -> KS-1986's merge hold RELEASED (merges after its tier-1 gate + Wednesday's GO). Delivered into the F 32nd brief before send (verified at the destination inbox).
- 07:08:03 "Decision secuura-ks1401-058-merge-demo-billing-1104: a — Merge; I stop every demo redeploy until you say".
- 07:08:39 "but deploy everything now.  so both systems have all changes.  new demo rule takes affect after this deploy".
- WEDNESDAY'S READING (panel bf-e8c5f03ff094, correction offered, none yet): merge PR 2002 now; THIS round brings BOTH kintsugi and demo to everything merged INCLUDING 058; the demo stop starts after this round; each box reads its tenant-less charge_events count before 058 and it is reported with the deploy (not waited on).
- AFTER THIS ROUND: NO demo redeploy without Kam's word. Write that STOP into every later Secuura deploy brief.
- Standing: Spark IGNORED until he says (11-04 16:42); October deploy grant extended until further notice; 11-04 09:16 'clear and close as many in progress tickets as possible'.

## FLOOR at 07:14 (pane list)
- **D 52nd** %152 (Opus): demo deploy. Building d14 at 035685291b9d (14 batches of 2, floor 12,000 MB; batch 1 at 20:10Z, 47,976 MB free). Told (ANSWER 20:10Z, SUPERSEDES the earlier pinned-round mail + ITEM e): HOLD after the build, no migration/swap, until 'NEW PIN <sha> (Seat D 52nd)' = PR 2002's squash; then rebuild only what the 1-squash delta changes (expect migrations + originate), read demo's tenant-less charge_events count, apply 056+057+058 (tracker 56 -> 59), swap 27 api-gateway last, 30-min KS-1244 watch, STATUS B. demo-service excluded; Stripe test; no prune (a floor stop = card Kam for a one-off demo cache prune).
- **B 93rd** %155 (Sonnet): merge seat, PR 2002 (head eec20acf0b257d6313331d01042abcad2a1d7fb0) onto develop 035685291b9d: recomputes tree, Gate 190 notes, READY, waits for Wednesday's GO 'GO: merge PR 2002 at eec20acf0b25 on develop 035685291b9d (Seat B 93rd)'. After MERGED: mail D 52nd 'NEW PIN <squash> (Seat D 52nd)' AT ONCE; then PR 1383 closed by B 93rd. Later QUEUE items (only by Wednesday's QUEUE mail): PR 2003, PR-B.
- **F 32nd** %154 (Opus): PR-B KS-1986 from F 31st's local commit 577f668f4786 (worktree Blockchain/worktrees/s-f31-ks1986): PG15 cell (7 cases) + direction ratio -> push -> PR (line 1 = Kam's release) -> KS-1986 comment -> READY FOR GATE (tier 1: commission a gate like 191).
- **Gate 191** (Opus Agent subagent, background): PR 2003 KS-1958 head 8b140178276457116714892fe0cf73b9f1e92c8c; workdir 0_Brain/reference/2026-11-05_gate191-ks1958-pr2003/ (verdict.md). A ROTATION KILLS IT: rotate only after its verdict is read. On GO WITH NOTES: QUEUE PR 2003 to B 93rd (after 2002).

## THEN (owed, in order)
1. KINTSUGI round for the new develop (PR 2002's 058 + any later merges): a D 53rd deploy seat from D 51st/D 52nd records; tenant-less charge count read before 058, reported to Kam; kintsugi first is satisfied by prior rounds, but Kam said BOTH systems get everything now.
2. Close-out seat after D 52nd STATUS B: post-deploy keys (KS-1256, 1561, 1459, 1458, 1868 slices; KS-1234 NOT-RUN on both boxes, NODE_ENV development; KS-1233 needs the key; KS-1401 after 058 lands).
3. Filing seat: E 35th's five gate-189 candidates (0_Brain/reference/2026-11-04_gate189-ks1256-pr2001/ready_2001.txt) + F 31st's two (vc-issuer sibling read catches; certifierOrganizationId on existing cross-tenant paths, KS-590 a).
4. KS-1990 fresh-stack run. KS-911/912 launcher by-hash. CONTRIBUTING N/13 vs 16 (Stuart's KS-1366, Kam's call).
5. Carried: @azure/msal-node baseline dies MON 2026-11-09 (check its ticket); WED-155 (inbox_digest key in argv); INDEX.md refresh (last 10-27); stash@{0} never drop.

## SCORED TODAY
- F 31st 0.93 FINAL (PR 2003 raised; PR-B handed over). %153 closed.

## RULES APPLIED THIS SEAT
- A Kam ruling that changes a staged brief is written INTO the brief before it sends, and the sent copy is checked at the destination inbox.
- A Kam scope change mid-round goes to the running seat as a SUPERSEDES mail naming the mail and items it replaces; an earlier mail overtaken within minutes is named too.
- Subjects never carry stop/hold/checkpoint after the leading token (send_brief refuses).
- Launch at FULL = a waiter with rc on its own line (scratchpad f32_waiter.sh shape), never a chained launch.
