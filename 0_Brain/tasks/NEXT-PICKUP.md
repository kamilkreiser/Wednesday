# NEXT PICKUP

## ONE block (the 10:2x Saturday seat) — replace it, never append

**Kam is AWAY Sat 19 + Sun 20.** `tasks/WEEK-INSTRUCTION.md` is LIVE to the end of Sun 2026-09-20: merge on Wednesday's signed GO after a QA gate (Secuura CLAUDE.md merge section: "Wednesday's GO, naming the head SHA, is the approval"); deploy KINTSUGI ONLY; NOT demo; the signature classes still pause (KS-1250, KS-1175; money; external comms beyond rule-7); auth last. He leaves again MONDAY NIGHT 2026-09-21. `fleet/USAGE_STOP` = 90; gauge 51% at 10:23. `local-model/night/ALLOW_SEATS` is armed to Sun 2026-09-20 23:00 (epoch 1789909200).

### FLOOR at 12:4x
`%0` wednesday · `%110` **Seat B 3rd** (pane name `Secuura/Blockchain-B`) MERGING on Wednesday's signed GO (sent 02:41:53Z, verified): nine heads in the gate's order #1063 → #1064 → #1067 → #1069 → #1068 → #1066 → #1065 → #1061 → #1062, blob-checked against the gate's MERGE ADDENDUM before each; then KS-864 → Backlog, ONE N62-3 ticket, rule-7, ONE STATUS with the nine merge commits, then wrap. · `%1` monitor. Gate #1061-#1069 DONE (verdict 02:39:51Z: 8 GO WITH FINDINGS + #1065 GO; report `Testing Agent MAIN/projects/secuura/reports/2026-09-19-batch1061-1069-tier1-r1/report.md`); scored 1.00; pane closed.

### 🔴 FIRST ACTS for whoever holds this seat next
1. `kam_rulings_today.sh` + `reconcile_rulings.py` (0 panel lines today as of 12:4x).
2. **On Seat B 3rd's merge STATUS:** verify the develop tip by ls-remote and the nine merge commits (blob equality on at least #1061 and #1062, the tier-1 two); score the seat; close its pane after its wrap (same action). **Kintsugi then lags develop by nine PRs** — two are runtime (#1061 originate adminConfig, #1062 preflight.sh, which is not a container). A kintsugi deploy is inside the week grant; size it first (disk 27 G free; budget the transient ~3.8 G per service).
3. **Ornith: the feed is READY and waits only on the merges.** The gate's 15 NOT-PINNED rows (in its mail + report) are test_only briefs on files the nine PRs create or change: KS-1206 null / 0 / float / numeric string / lower bound 1; KS-1260 OLDFORMULA / also-line / NONE-declared exit; KS-1101 N-3 completeness; KS-864 NODE_ENV; KS-739 non-403; KS-1062 FAILEDMETA; KS-1258 REQUIRED-block :576 + six start shapes; KS-1230 second integration. Brief them (a subagent, the round-8 shape) the moment develop carries the merges. No tickets are filed for these rows (ruled in the GO).
4. **Round 10 (AUTH TEST-ONLY, zero product bytes)** is running as a subagent; read its result against the boundary before queueing anything.
5. **Seat B 4th (%112, launched 13:18) is raising 9 held fixes as 7 PRs** (brief `fleet/briefs_staged/2026-09-19_raise_seatB_successor4.md`): KS-1276 · KS-1269+1269-U · KS-1238 F1ii+F1i · KS-1206-N61-1 · KS-864-N64-1 · KS-1230-N69-1 · KS-739-N66-1. Next: its plan confirmation (rule KS-1276 / KS-1238 after-merge states), READY → ONE batch gate (the #1061 drafter's shape) → GO → merges → ONE kintsugi deploy (originate + vc-issuer + api-gateway as measured). **Held for the batch AFTER that: 1** — `READY_KS-1258-N68-1`.

### Reallocated to a Claude seat (Kam's 09-16 counter; do NOT queue at the local model)
KS-1168, KS-1163, KS-998, KS-866 (from 09-16/17) · **the KS-871 remnant** (round 9): `services/api-gateway/src/middleware/audit.ts:333` still logs `path: req.path` on a failed audit write (on a refused erasure that is the trimmed `/`); KS-871 is In Progress, so the builder refuses it → a line for whichever seat next takes KS-871.

### HOLDS
KS-1250, KS-1175 Kam's · nothing to demo · no contact with Peter/Stuart beyond rule-7 facts · auth last · never delete · Tuesday owns Datasec.

### ROUTE TO KAM (Monday 21) — one list
1. Peter's two KS-1195 questions (per-key rateLimit for S connector keys; KS-1206 "429 forever"; PS-928 Stuart Urgent) — unanswered by design.
2. Peter's KS-593 addition: fuzzed wallet authenticate/verify → 500 where 400 belongs.
3. Kintsugi has NO connector allow-list configured (measured by seat A 12th).
4. Kintsugi disk: 27 G free after seat A 13th's deploy; budget the TRANSIENT per-service build cost (~3.8 G seen), not the image size.
5. KS-1262 (High) test-token severity check: unowned.
6. The drive sync keeps making `(conflict_on_…)` copies (27 untracked in WEDNESDAY; they make panel_sync SKIP its rebase every cycle), 9 in the vault; not removed.
7. From 09-18: seat A's launcher F-02 (no keychain SSH identity), the open card `wed-boot-read-exceeds-the-context-window`, O-1 (CI jobs never start), the NSG's dynamic IP.
8. report-796 F-01/F-03 (`scripts/audit/*.mjs`): open at the tip; F-01 needs a new env seam and F-03 contradicts the code's own SKIP comment → a ruling, not a local-model ticket.
9. KS-1269-U: should `/unrevoke` refuse `index < 0`? KS-662 lists `/unrevoke {index:-1} → 200` as NON-RULED; the held fix leaves it unchanged.
10. **Wednesday's reading to confirm:** with the non-auth pool exhausted (rounds 8-9), round 10 opened AUTH surfaces to TEST-ONLY local-model work (tamper-pinned cells, zero product bytes changed), on the recorded rule 'auth product EDITS stay out'. Default: it continues unless he says auth means tests too.

### OWED (tooling, mine, none urgent)
`brief_and_launch.sh` prints "launched" after cockpit SKIPS a same-name pane (false receipt; ledger 09-19) — needs `--pane-name` + rc 1 on skip · `cockpit.sh say %<id>` fails silently (use the NAME form) · `inbox_digest.sh` shows Datasec previews in the wednesday-agent@ section · a wake-turn Ornith print · `note_entry.sh` warn on a typed clock later than its stamp · a UTC-bound helper for commissions (ledger 09-19, the one-day-late cutoff).
