# NEXT PICKUP (Fri 16 Oct afternoon)

## 0. FIRST ACTIONS FOR THE NEXT WEDNESDAY SEAT
1. Boot reads as the launcher says. Then `kam_rulings_today.sh`, `kam_msgs.sh 3`, `newmail.sh` (never piped), `fleet_ack.sh list`, `decision_queue.sh list open`, `fleet/usage_gate.sh --check`, `fleet/cockpit/pane_prompt_check.sh %0`, and NEW: `bash 2_Project_Files/local-model/spark/tunnel.sh check` (re-open with `tunnel.sh up`).
2. **Kam's standing words (EXPIRING-GRANTS top rows, end = the quota reset ~Sun 18 Oct 1pm):** (a) Spark only for new ticket work, briefed by Wednesday by hand; (b) push/merge/deploy what is ready FIRST, Claude seats past the stop for those jobs only. Weekly gauge **99%** (statusline 7d:99% renews 2d 0h at 12:53 Fri). Wednesday's stated reading, uncorrected: **no Claude launches at >=99%** (at 100% this seat stops too).
3. **MONDAY 2026-10-19: WED-154**, the storage policy for old Blockchain files and old tests (policy + dry-run + first measured report + a card; nothing removed before Kam sees it).
4. **A checkpoint turn never ends on a declared default alone** (ledger 10-16): Spark round running, brief queued, a wake armed, or a measured WHY in spark/queue.md. The 06:0x seat sat idle 09:15 -> 12:45.

## 1. STATE (13:1x Fri) — NO Claude seat live; panes %0 + %1
- **develop = 76698952a75717bbcbc35ace85d08d6758d8844f** (ls-remote 13:0x). Nothing deployed.
- **#1560 (KS-1543 parts 2+3) head 180c7c822b571b8ff8b5ea15d4286277948c66c0 and #1561 (KS-1462 item 1) head ba8c18794beddd47e7704891e6cbd4efda7664f6**: READY FOR GATE (R 46th, wrapped; HANDOVER Blockchain/5_Project_History/2026-10-16_seatR-46th/HANDOVER.md). Gate waits on Kam's card `secuura-gate-at-99pct-two-spark-prs-1016` (default b: after Sunday's reset, or at once on a /login). One batched Opus gate on 13/16 legs (ruled); then merge one at a time, head == GO sha, restore Linear In Progress/contributes.
- **HELD, waiting for Kam:** PR #1555 (KS-1114) head c85cc28d, card secuura-ks1114-title-reply-leaks-details-fix-now-or-wait-1015.
- **HELD Spark READY for the next raise round:** night/READY_KS-1541-REFUSALNOTE-1_spark-dsv4flash_BRIEFED-CODEPATCH-INFO-PASS-7of7_2026-10-16.diff.md.
- **KS-1614 item 4 golden READY (not a Spark pass):** night/briefs/ks_1614_p1/ (test-only [1n] cell, kills mutant M2; golden proven to apply byte-identical at 76698952a757). Spark lint refuses test_only (not wired into round.sh). Either the next Claude raise seat carries the golden through a gate, or wire test_only first.
- **Waiting for the reset:** KS-1612 (real Postgres), KS-1613 (test-only shell cells, same gap), KS-1611.

## 2. KAM'S CARDS OPEN
secuura-ks724-locked-account-template-exclusion-1015 · secuura-ks1385-null-issuer-certifications-1015 · secuura-ks1114-title-reply-leaks-details-fix-now-or-wait-1015 · secuura-gate-at-99pct-two-spark-prs-1016. Plus 3 Datasec + 1 Tuesday NAS-sync (hers). Unanswered panel question (bf-f955bd7b56aa959f): lean boots at >=95%? Not a rule until he answers.

## 3. SPARK
- Tunnel guard BUILT 10-16 13:0x: spark/tunnel.sh check|up (5 arms), doctor WARN leg (both ways). **round.sh's in-path `tunnel.sh up` before ENDPOINT DOWN is NOT yet exercised by a real round**: the next real round is the test (drop the tunnel first on purpose, read round.json for the "tunnel.sh up rc=0" line).
- Queue EMPTY with a measured WHY (spark/queue.md 13:10). Next candidates need a fresh screen or the test_only tier.

## 4. OWED BY WEDNESDAY (own tools, small)
1. Wire tier test_only into spark/round.sh + brief_lint (tasks/test_only/build_test_only_input.sh + checker MODE=test_only), arms first; ks_1614_p1 is its first run (IMPROVEMENTS 10-16 13:10).
2. cockpit.sh say --mail: stamp the mail's own timestamp into the pointer; `say %4 ...` (pane id) is a SILENT no-op: make an unknown name fail loudly.
3. Proposal for Kam (not urgent): Secuura launches default SECUURA_ALLOW_ONDISK_KEY=1 (or seed the keychain) so F-02 stops leaving a keepalive-less core.sshCommand.
4. INDEX.md refresh (newest block 2026-09-23).
5. Deploy round (Kintsugi): READ-ONLY census seat first, only once tasks/DEPLOY-BLOCKERS.md clears (GATEWAY_VOUCH_SECRET first). After the reset.
6. stash@{0} from 10-14 is KEPT, never dropped.
