# NEXT PICKUP (Mon 19 Oct, ~16:30)

## 0. FIRST ACTIONS FOR THE NEXT WEDNESDAY SEAT
1. Boot reads as the launcher says. Then kam_rulings_today.sh (the WHOLE day), reconcile_rulings.py, `bash 2_Project_Files/tools/newmail.sh` (to a file), fleet_ack.sh list (an `answered` sometimes cannot see a fresh QUESTION for minutes; re-run it at the next wake), decision_queue.sh list open, fleet/usage_gate.sh --check, `local-model/spark/tunnel.sh check`.
2. **In force:** Kam 10-18 "new account: tickets, backlog, routing definition, Spark as many as it can handle". Routing v1.0. Gauge 33% at 16:2x. **Kam 15:50: Stuart's list, "action what you can; anything you need from me, a card in fleet activity"** (section 2).
3. **Before ANY ruling or GO naming a push, force-push or merge route: read `.githooks/pre-push` refusal branches in the same action and cite the line** (ledger w=3 REGRESSION today; promotion owed in section 4).
4. Commit your own files by pathspec before any tool that pulls.

## 1. LIVE WORK (16:3x)
- **develop = 7e2f8157cec243a6255aab2c4fc8678063da317b** (#1607 KS-1385 issuer freeze merged, tree 5adb4e513696 verified by Wednesday's own fetch). 45 Secuura merges since 19:00 Sun. Nothing deployed.
- **Seat R 52nd (%12, launcher-pinned "Opus 5"; switch to Opus 5.5 at its first REAL idle):**
  - **holds a GO (16:23)** for the five from gate V1 (`0_Brain/reference/2026-10-19_gate-V1-screen12-five/verdict.md`, re-hashed EQUAL): #1609, #1610, #1611, #1612, then #1608 last; chained landing tree f8301c94deacd5621686413e9a51a70465f88a33. **#1608 switches a dead audit export ON**: R files ONE Medium ticket for its four faults (50-row cap, `to` day dropped, `type` ignored, spec mismatch) BEFORE #1608 merges, marked "fix before this export is deployed". On its MERGED mail: ls-remote + fetch into your own scratch clone, compare the tree.
  - **#1597 re-pinned at e48c0b821f48** (author fixed: 0 other-client identity in its commit list; blobs identical to O1's gated head). **Gate W1 (Sonnet, background sub-agent of the 13:1x seat) was running at the rotation:** brief + verdict `0_Brain/reference/2026-10-19_gate-W1-pr1597-repin/`. **If verdict.md is absent, the gate died with the seat: re-launch it from the same brief.** On GO: send R the merge GO (landed tree = W1's prediction, R's was ca879b446810), then `decision_queue.sh --delivered secuura-datasec-author-on-two-branch-commits-1019` naming the merge. After #1597 merges: the KS-1634 v2 Spark brief (`local-model/night/briefs/ks_1634_v2_p1/`) re-pins and runs, and Stuart's S-shaped cell joins that follow-up (TRIAGE.md row 3).
  - Then KS-1622, which WAITS until Seat E's KS-1195 PR merges (same `routes/platform.ts`).
- **Seat C 25th (%13, launcher-pinned model; switch at first idle):** KS-1402's develop 500 on Stuart's custody transfers (blocks every deploy). Plan CONFIRMED 16:2x: measure the cause on a scratch PG (path diff 65d7722f8..7e2f8157cec2 incl. migrations), fix to the pre-regression 404, red-first, READY → tier-1 gate. No holder stub (Kam's card).
- **Seat E 3rd (%14, launcher-pinned model; switch at first idle):** plan CONFIRMED 16:2x: posts Kam's 9 Oct rulings verbatim on KS-1195 and KS-1384 (mails the comment ids → `decision_queue.sh --delivered secuura-ks1195-s-key-ceiling-1009` and `... secuura-ks1384-anchor-per-event-1009`), builds KS-1195 (gateway passes `rateLimit` from `PLATFORM_S_CONNECTOR_RATE_LIMIT`, default 3000; no security-service change; a rotated key is a new key at 3,000), then replies on KS-1385/1612 (deploy conditions only), KS-1604 (bind at the organisation level), KS-1575/1596 (holding), KS-1387 (ASK for rebuild evidence, do not close). READY → tier-1 gate.
- **Spark:** 23 PASSes held today. Queue empty with reason (pool used up by SCREEN_10-12). Next screen once R's batch merges frees files; the Stuart-list items KS-1629 (one file, Spark-briefable) is a candidate after KS-1603 in the anchoring lane.
- **Drive:** DevMASTER 52% (955 GB free). Still Kam's hands: two rm commands for the oMLX Qwen folders. Gatesets: 161 eligible but git-TRACKED: plan a git rm with Kam.

## 2. STUART'S LIST (Kam 15:50) — the plan
- **Triage:** `0_Brain/reference/2026-10-19_stuart-list-triage/TRIAGE.md` (26 dispositions; read its BLUF and "(A) items by lane").
- **Five B cards POSTED** (`.../CARDS_POSTED.md`): ks1402 who creates the holder · ks1384 schedule the per-event anchor project · ks1580 erasure-revoked key code · ks1570 "have you seen the round" (closes DEPLOY-BLOCKERS.md:7) · S signing contract additions. Act on Kam's taps per their options.
- **Launched:** C (KS-1402 500), E (the two rulings + KS-1195 + replies).
- **STILL TO LAUNCH (free files):** (3) the anchoring lane (J's files are free; J 13th wrapped): KS-1603 interim ownership check (both upserts) → KS-1629 → KS-723 → KS-1454; (4) the certifications lane: KS-1557 harness step (both MT modes) → write side → KS-1633. Briefs from TRIAGE.md rows 4a, 9d, 8b, 8a, 7, 9e. Plus read-only box reads: KS-1584 provisioning-key row, the KS-1634 census with Stuart's predicate, `SIMULATE_ANCHORING` on demo.
- **DEPLOY-BLOCKERS.md:** add the KS-1402 develop 500 as a row; line 39 is stale (#1568 merged).
- **Kam's alone:** any reply to Stuart outside a ticket, re-minting/rotating S keys, any landing date.

## 3. KAM'S CARDS
Open from today: the five Stuart cards above (+ Tuesday's Composer card). To deliver: `secuura-datasec-author-on-two-branch-commits-1019` (after #1597 merges), `secuura-ks1195-s-key-ceiling-1009` and `secuura-ks1384-anchor-per-event-1009` (after E's comments). Delivered today: ks1612 round 3, storage 27, drive cleanup.

## 4. OWED BY WEDNESDAY (own tools, small)
1. **PROMOTION (w=3 today):** send_brief.sh advisory: a body naming push/force-push/merge-route with no `pre-push:` citation prints a warning. Arms first (a body that should warn, one that should not).
2. cockpit.sh say --mail: stamp the mail's timestamp into the pointer; `say %4` (pane id) is a silent no-op: fail loudly.
3. pretooluse_no_cd.sh: allow a variable path that resolves inside WEDNESDAY or the session scratchpad.
4. Deploy round (Kintsugi): READ-ONLY census seat first, once DEPLOY-BLOCKERS.md clears (needs Kam's ks1570 tap + Stuart's dev-ps deploy + the KS-1402 500 fix).
5. Fable 5.1 coordinator-task trial (routing decision 7).
6. The 95 `t <t@e.com>`-authored commits on develop: check whether they are tracked.
7. Keep stash@{0} and older stashes; never drop them.
8. Gate brief template: name every touched service's suites as RUN or NOT-tested-by-name.
9. J 13th's history entry sits at line 249, not the top: the project's own seat fixes it (not Wednesday's file).
