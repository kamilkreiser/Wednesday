# NEXT PICKUP

## ONE block (the 10:2x Saturday seat) — replace it, never append

**Kam is AWAY Sat 19 + Sun 20.** `tasks/WEEK-INSTRUCTION.md` is LIVE to the end of Sun 2026-09-20: merge on Wednesday's signed GO after a QA gate (Secuura CLAUDE.md merge section: "Wednesday's GO, naming the head SHA, is the approval"); deploy KINTSUGI ONLY; NOT demo; the signature classes still pause (KS-1250, KS-1175; money; external comms beyond rule-7); auth last. He leaves again MONDAY NIGHT 2026-09-21. `fleet/USAGE_STOP` = 90; gauge 51% at 10:23. `local-model/night/ALLOW_SEATS` is armed to Sun 2026-09-20 23:00 (epoch 1789909200).

### FLOOR at 16:2x
`%0` wednesday · `%1` monitor. **No agent live.** Today, all verified at source: #1061-#1069 and #1070-#1076 MERGED (16 PRs, 18 local-model fixes; develop **f9c28a8b8**, tree bc4d0ed7f). Kintsugi deployed twice and now runs **f9c28a8b8** (seat A 14th: vc-issuer + originate swapped; api-gateway the same id, not restarted; V1-V7 PASS, V1 by behaviour on a bounded retry; rollback tag `pre-20260919c`; KS-535 re-verified). Tickets filed: KS-1279, KS-1280, KS-1281. Every seat and gate today scored 1.00.

### 🔴 FIRST ACTS for whoever holds this seat next
1. `kam_rulings_today.sh` + `reconcile_rulings.py`. **Every wake turn starts with `python3 2_Project_Files/fleet/ornith_status.py`** (ledger 09-19 w=10).
2. **Seat B 5th raise:** its brief is being drafted by a subagent into `2_Project_Files/fleet/briefs_staged/2026-09-19_raise_seatB_successor5.md` (model: `…successor4.md`). READ IT WHOLE, then `brief_and_launch.sh --to "Secuura/Blockchain" --subject "SUCCESSOR: Seat B 5th - raise eight held local-model test-only fixes, one batch" --body-file <it>`; confirm the pane from `tmux list-panes`. **The eight held:** `READY_KS-1258-N68-1`, `READY_KS-1258-N68-2`, `READY_KS-1062-N67-1` (archived → NO Refs), `READY_KS-1260-N62`, `READY_KS-1230-N74-1`, `READY_KS-1206-N72-1`, `READY_KS-739-N75-1` (archived → NO Refs), `READY_KS-1238-N76-1` (AUTH test-only → tier 1, pushed last). Then: plan confirmation → READY → ONE batch gate (the #1070 drafter shape: `fleet/qa-agent/gatesets/2026-09-19_gate1070to1076/`) → GO → merges. All eight are test-only, so **no kintsugi deploy is needed after them** (test files change no running image; api-gateway's builder-only case proves it).
3. **Ornith:** queue EMPTY with a reason (every briefable row is held above); the next feed = the Seat B 5th gate's NOT-PINNED list. Owed harness extension: the test_only builder's runner pin for vc-issuer, so `night/briefs/KS-1269-N71-1.md` (the null index) can run.
4. Harness fixed today: `local-model/tasks/test_only/checker.sh` restores a previous run's modified test file (IMPROVEMENTS row).

### Reallocated to a Claude seat (Kam's 09-16 counter; do NOT queue at the local model)
KS-1168, KS-1163, KS-998, KS-866 (from 09-16/17) · **the KS-871 remnant** (round 9): `services/api-gateway/src/middleware/audit.ts:333` still logs `path: req.path` on a failed audit write (on a refused erasure that is the trimmed `/`); KS-871 is In Progress, so the builder refuses it → a line for whichever seat next takes KS-871.

### HOLDS
KS-1250, KS-1175 Kam's · nothing to demo · no contact with Peter/Stuart beyond rule-7 facts · auth last · never delete · Tuesday owns Datasec.

### ROUTE TO KAM (Monday 21) — one list
1. Peter's two KS-1195 questions (per-key rateLimit for S connector keys; KS-1206 "429 forever"; PS-928 Stuart Urgent) — unanswered by design.
2. Peter's KS-593 addition: fuzzed wallet authenticate/verify → 500 where 400 belongs.
3. Kintsugi has NO connector allow-list configured (measured by seat A 12th).
4. Kintsugi disk: 27 G free after seat A 13th's deploy; budget the TRANSIENT per-service build cost (~3.8 G seen), not the image size.
5. KS-1262 (High) test-token severity check: unowned.
6. The drive sync keeps making `(conflict_on_…)` copies (27 untracked in WEDNESDAY; they make panel_sync SKIP its rebase every cycle), 9 in the vault; not removed.
7. From 09-18: seat A's launcher F-02 (no keychain SSH identity), the open card `wed-boot-read-exceeds-the-context-window`, O-1 (CI jobs never start), the NSG's dynamic IP.
8. report-796 F-01/F-03 (`scripts/audit/*.mjs`): open at the tip; F-01 needs a new env seam and F-03 contradicts the code's own SKIP comment → a ruling, not a local-model ticket.
9. KS-1269-U: should `/unrevoke` refuse `index < 0`? KS-662 lists `/unrevoke {index:-1} → 200` as NON-RULED; the held fix leaves it unchanged.
10. **Wednesday's reading to confirm:** with the non-auth pool exhausted (rounds 8-9), round 10 opened AUTH surfaces to TEST-ONLY local-model work (tamper-pinned cells, zero product bytes changed), on the recorded rule 'auth product EDITS stay out'. Default: it continues unless he says auth means tests too.

### OWED (tooling, mine, none urgent)
`brief_and_launch.sh` prints "launched" after cockpit SKIPS a same-name pane (false receipt; ledger 09-19) — needs `--pane-name` + rc 1 on skip · `cockpit.sh say %<id>` fails silently (use the NAME form) · `inbox_digest.sh` shows Datasec previews in the wednesday-agent@ section · a wake-turn Ornith print · `note_entry.sh` warn on a typed clock later than its stamp · a UTC-bound helper for commissions (ledger 09-19, the one-day-late cutoff).
