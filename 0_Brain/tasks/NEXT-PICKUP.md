# NEXT PICKUP — Thu 5 Nov 2026, 07:14 (the 06:00 morning seat)

## KAM TODAY (live board, view=wednesday, read with kam_msgs.sh; all three RULED in the store, HTTP 200)
- 07:07:25 "Decision wed-morning-fleet-activity-1105: a — Plan stands" -> KS-1986's merge hold RELEASED (merges after its tier-1 gate + Wednesday's GO). Delivered into the F 32nd brief before send (verified at the destination inbox).
- 07:08:03 "Decision secuura-ks1401-058-merge-demo-billing-1104: a — Merge; I stop every demo redeploy until you say".
- 07:08:39 "but deploy everything now.  so both systems have all changes.  new demo rule takes affect after this deploy".
- WEDNESDAY'S READING (panel bf-e8c5f03ff094, correction offered, none yet): merge PR 2002 now; THIS round brings BOTH kintsugi and demo to everything merged INCLUDING 058; the demo stop starts after this round; each box reads its tenant-less charge_events count before 058 and it is reported with the deploy (not waited on).
- AFTER THIS ROUND: NO demo redeploy without Kam's word. Write that STOP into every later Secuura deploy brief.
- Standing: Spark IGNORED until he says (11-04 16:42); October deploy grant extended until further notice; 11-04 09:16 'clear and close as many in progress tickets as possible'.

## FLOOR at 08:21 (pane list) — the 08:07 successor seat
- **D 52nd** %152 (Opus): demo deploy RE-PINNED to e899463d2a0b1b30f2cff46b23d001622620029a (SUPERSEDES the 4ff25fb4f2c0 pin; PR 2003 merged after it). Seat measured: delta 5 paths (3 vc-issuer + 2 PR 2003 fragments), rebuild 4 of 33 (originate, migrations, api-gateway, vc-issuer), 0 migrations in the delta; 056+057+058 (tracker 56 -> 59), demo tenant-less charge count 0 (re-read before apply); swap 27, api-gateway last; 30-min KS-1244 watch; REVISION at e899463d2a0b; STATUS B. Interim HANDOVER at 5_Project_History/2026-11-05_seatD-52nd/HANDOVER.md. AFTER THIS ROUND: NO demo redeploy without Kam's word.
- **K 14th** %156 (Opus): KS-1959 fail-closed revoke (vc-issuer), brief briefs_staged/2026-11-05_seatK_ks1959_failclosed_revoke.md. Expect plan confirmation + a 'ks1959 memory semantics' QUESTION (options a/b/c; c crosses KS-1958's DB-row-wins design: if c is recommended, it is Wednesday's design call inside the 1103 rulings, card Kam only if it changes an outcome he chose). Ends READY FOR GATE -> tier-1 gate.
- **F 33rd** %157 (Opus): PR 2004 round 2 of 2 (G192-F2 only), card secuura-pr2004-ks1986-gate192-hold-1105 DEFAULT (card still OPEN). Files G192-F1 as one ticket. Ends READY FOR GATE -> gate 193 tier 1 (commission from gate 192's commission.md shape). NO merge without Kam's tap on 1105. A line-682 QUESTION ('ks1986 f2 scope') is possible: Kam's card names only the read-failure case.
- B 93rd WRAPPED 0.93 (PR 2002 + PR 2003 merged; develop e899463d2a0b verified by ls-remote 08:1x), %155 closed.

## THEN (owed, in order)
1. KINTSUGI round for develop e899463d2a0b (PR 2002's 058 + PR 2003), after D 52nd STATUS B: a D 53rd deploy seat from D 51st/D 52nd records; tenant-less charge count read before 058, reported to Kam; kintsugi first is satisfied by prior rounds, but Kam said BOTH systems get everything now.
2. Close-out seat after D 52nd STATUS B: post-deploy keys (KS-1256, 1561, 1459, 1458, 1868 slices; KS-1234 NOT-RUN on both boxes, NODE_ENV development; KS-1233 needs the key; KS-1401 after 058 lands).
3. KS-1959 fail-closed FIX (gate 191 F2, HIGH pre-existing: a revoke whose DB UPDATE fails answers 200 and still verifies true; same family as Kam's 1103 rulings): a build seat, tier-1 gate. Also a filing seat: (c) verify-file passes 'sha256:<hex>' to crossTenantLookup vs registry content_hash (production form UNMEASURED; F 32nd, verification.ts:900/934/783); gate 191 F3 (by-hash 500 on a hostile value, LOW); E 35th's five gate-189 candidates (0_Brain/reference/2026-11-04_gate189-ks1256-pr2001/ready_2001.txt) + F 31st's two (vc-issuer sibling read catches; certifierOrganizationId on existing cross-tenant paths, KS-590 a).
4. KS-1990 fresh-stack run. KS-911/912 launcher by-hash. CONTRIBUTING N/13 vs 16 (Stuart's KS-1366, Kam's call).
5. Carried: @azure/msal-node baseline dies MON 2026-11-09 (check its ticket); WED-155 (inbox_digest key in argv); INDEX.md refresh (last 10-27); stash@{0} never drop.

## SCORED TODAY
- F 31st 0.93 FINAL (PR 2003 raised; PR-B handed over). %153 closed.

## RULES APPLIED THIS SEAT
- A Kam ruling that changes a staged brief is written INTO the brief before it sends, and the sent copy is checked at the destination inbox.
- A Kam scope change mid-round goes to the running seat as a SUPERSEDES mail naming the mail and items it replaces; an earlier mail overtaken within minutes is named too.
- Subjects never carry stop/hold/checkpoint after the leading token (send_brief refuses).
- Launch at FULL = a waiter with rc on its own line (scratchpad f32_waiter.sh shape), never a chained launch.
