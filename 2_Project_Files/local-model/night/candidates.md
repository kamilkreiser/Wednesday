# Ornith candidates — derived 2026-09-17 05:20 from 313 KS Backlog/Todo tickets (read-only, unpaginated)

A CENSUS for the coordinator to brief from, easy → hard (Kam 2026-09-15 16:40 / 18:19). A ticket here is a candidate, not a task: read it, read the file at the tip, write `night/briefs/<id>.md`, then queue it. Auth-shaped titles are excluded (LAST); Peter/Stuart tickets and PR-attached tickets are excluded outright.

|---|---|---|
| KS-744 | a PRODUCT edit to `services/api-gateway/src/middleware/auth.ts` (:389/:394 header guards): auth product edits stay out of the local-model week grant until Kam names them (EXPIRING-GRANTS, Wednesday's 09-15 reading), AND seat A's KS-1207 (B) fix edits the same file next — two agents never on one file | routed to seat A's Claude queue AFTER KS-1207 (same file, serial); the brief `night/briefs/KS-744.md` is usable by that seat as its spec; the residual (tokens missing role/userId still 500) needs a ruling — PR says "Refs KS-744" |

Spec: the 200 schema already permits {exists:true} (yaml WalletStatusResponse required [exists], other fields optional; zod .optional()+.passthrough()) so the spec need not move; its description PROSE goes stale (auth.openapi.ts:1864-1868 + yaml:17732-17736) — an owed two-file follow-up, after open #922 (which edits the yaml).

     SECOND FIT: none (see POOL STATE).
     KS-805   item 1 (PATCH UpdateOAuthAppSchema redirectUris .min(1), routes/oauth.ts:1239) is a one-line runtime edit, BUT the published PATCH body does not carry it: auth.openapi.ts:2896 z.array(z.string().url()).optional() and yaml /api/oauth/apps/{id} patch redirectUris has no minItems (python yaml.safe_load; control: OAuthAppCreateRequest.redirectUris minItems 1). A runtime-only .min(1) makes a spec-legal body 400 (the positive_data_acceptance drift class, KS-591; ks796-f6 schema-identity discipline), so the spec must move in the same PR: auth.openapi.ts + the regenerated yaml = multi-file, and open #922 edits that yaml. Items 2/3 (deny Location: undefined, GET 500 for a zero-URI app) read as already closed at the tip by the shared resolver: routes/oauth.ts:264 refuses an unregistered redirect_uri (invalid_redirect_uri) and :288 refuses an absent one unless exactly one URI is registered (KS-822 F-7, invalid_request); the deny branch (:646-658) returns authorizeRefusal before any URL is built.

     POOL STATE: with KS-1009 briefed and KS-805 refused on the spec, 17g's two remaining single-file auth-tier candidates are both closed.

     FITS from this search: KS-944 — TEST-ONLY. A new services/auth vitest file imports the real auth.openapi.ts and pins the exact sorted table of the six /api/auth/wallet/ registrations (challenge, verify, authenticate, status = security [] ; link, unlink = bearerAuth), plus a CONTROL that selects link/unlink by path, plus COMPLETENESS. Tamper auth.openapi.ts:1829 (authenticate security [] -> bearerAuth, the ticket's own red-proof). Gap measured: whole auth suite 751/751 green under the tamper without the file (positive control: a module-scope throw on :1829 reds s130-f6, 749/751). briefs/KS-944.md, inputs/code_944.json; checker PASS 7/7 strict, mode test_only (fin0 draft input, fin1 placed input; A6 751 -> 754, NEW reds []; A7 tsc rc 0); wrong variants FAIL A4 RED-FIRST (a pin blind to the tamper) and FAIL A3 (test-only) (a product hunk added). NOT queued. 17g's reason (index.ts/proxy.ts/specRouteMap.ts partition + decisions) was the ticket's MECHANISM prose: the fix shape is one cell over the spec source, the ticket has 0 comments and no decision.

     NOT tested: no model round (nothing queued); the systemTest half of KS-928 (KS-502, live stack); KS-1140 / KS-1131 were not driven under their tampers.
     POOL STATE: KS-928 is ready behind one Wednesday ruling (merged-PR build). KS-1140 and KS-1131 are refused on shape, not partition; record them as such. Harness item still owed: build_input.sh refuse-only-OPEN-PRs seam (IMPROVEMENTS 03:52 item 1) would make this a plain build.
